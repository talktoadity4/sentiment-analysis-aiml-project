Burton Technologies Acoustibuds,Electronics,4,"I have a Jabra BT5020 bluetooth headset and am constantly misplacing the manufacturer earbuds since they only stay on securely for the first week.

I looked all over the 'Net to find BT5020 earbud replacements, and there are none!     I demo'ed Acoustibuds at the 2009 CES, and loved them as soon as I put them on. They are the perfect size replacement and provide more noise isolation than the stock Jabra earbuds. I would recommend you try both sizes on the Acoustibuds, since the #6 is a little snug on my ears (hey, it was free). When it wears out (they seem to be pretty sturdy, so it might be a while), I'll reorder a set of #5's.

Sennheiser RF Wireless Headphone System,Electronics,5,"Equipment used:<br /><br />Amp - Arcam a75<br />CD - Denon DCD-520<br /><br />Headphone docking sets, for want of a better term, have never really appealed to me in the past; I have fairly decent audio equipment, and I've got some nice headphones with long leads to use with them. It may be in my mind, but when I used to listen to wireless systems in the 1990s, the sound never convinced me in the slightest - I didn't bother lingering to find out why; at the time I assumed that it might have been due to compression of the sound during the wireless bit (forgive me if I get too technical). Headphone output is all in the head in more ways than one.<br /><br />Well, I've changed my mind. I've always been an admirer of Sennheiser's headphone sound without finding it the most involving; their Momentums are a lovely example of their signature style - very pure, maybe slightly cold, lots of sound stage and separation, lovely for detailed listening such as live orchestral works, but lacking a certain sexiness to really get down on the dance floor.<br /><br />These are open-backed headphones; they are designed to let a bit of noise in and out - it improves the listening quality. If you dont want to hear external noises or have others hear what you are listening to, then you need the closed back variety.<br /><br />These ones produce a very warm sound, which manages to keep that unadulterated feel that people buy Sennheiser for; V-Moda m-100s they aren't, but there's never a moment of doubt in my mind when listening to Mingus, Monk or Miles - the sound is as good as the plug-in alternatives'. The open backs of the cans really lending a sense of space to live recordings; in fact, studio albums become noticeably less enjoyable at times, because you can hear when tracks have been dropped in, rather than recorded at the same time as something else. There's a sense of ease with which the headphones deal with what hits them - they glide; never do they strain.<br /><br />They definitely pass the sound test. I'll update this as they open out aurally. They are open-backed, so other people will be able to hear your music while you listen.<br /><br />The station provides input via two means - both digital and analogue (RCA). At last, you can put those old tape deck audio outputs to use again; they'll connect up to the back nicely. The controls are simple - you can set the output level manually, or use the auto option. It transmits on the 2.4 GHz wavelength.<br /><br />Sennheiser have got around the problem of internal batteries (and the limited lifespan thereof) very cleverly - this is a real problem with the Creative Soundblaster range of cans for example: they used an integrated internal battery that couldn't be removed; this meant that that the headphones probably had a lifespan of 5 years, which for the asking price was terrible. Sennheiser have placed an easily-removeable AAA rechargeable battery in each earpiece, accessed with a simple twist of the ear cushion housing; these batteries get recharged when the headphones are placed on the docking station and can simply be replaced by new ones very cheaply and easily; well done to them for that, even though it feels retro to be using AAA batteries again.<br /><br />The build quality is very good quality plastic all round, with reasonable leather in the usual places (I've felt nicer on headphones); dials glide smoothly and the user experience is a pleasant one, with nothing cheap or nasty to ignore. The ear cushions are velvet rather than leather, and can be worn comfortable for long periods - even by those with large ears.<br /><br />The controls on the headphones are easy to use, and offer volume and balance. Very easy to use. The transmitter supports an extra headphone if you happen to have another compatible pair lying around.<br /><br />The signal does work from room to room, with walls in between, but I did notice a regular sub-second of dropout from time to time (this might be because the 2.4ghz wavelength is a very busy one in my household - WiFi and Bluetooth all run on the same one). Apparently they have a range of up to 100 metres if you can remain in the line of sight. Good luck trying to do that down my busy London backroad.<br /><br />A minor grouch is with the connector leads provided - why make everything to such demanding standards, and then put bog standard cables in with it? The money saved must be minimal.<br /><br />Overall - I feel like I've brought my old, quality equipment up to date a bit now; my CDs and records are just as good as they always were, and I'm finally converted to the joys of modern wireless audio technology. Wonderful stuff.<br /><br />Most people will probably want headphones that they can also take outside with them, but for those of us who have invested a fair amount of money in their HiFi equipment and want to carry on using it and keeping it up to date, these headphones represent a very good investment.<br /><br />Edit 08-03-15: Frustratingly, I have not found a way to alter the bass and treble levels when heard on the headphones; the amp controls have no effect. This might just be me being dense.ave a range of up to 100 metres if you can remain in the line of sight. Good luck trying to do that down my busy London backroad.

iHome Bluetooth Wireless Speaker,Electronics,4,"I picked up this speaker because I was having a small get together, needed a way to stream some music from my Android tablet.<br /><br />The speaker is very well made, it feels really solid, and is small enough to be convenient, but still produces pretty good sound.  Not amazing, not audiophile level, but good enough to be worth it for the price.  Bass response is surprisingly good for such a tiny speaker, though again, it's not going to blow anyone away.<br /><br />The IDM8 suited my needs perfectly... the pairing function is simple and works flawlessly, although it's a shame it doesn't remember paired devices.  If you pair with your phone, then later pair with your tablet, you will have to re-pair if you want to use it with your phone again.  But again, the process is incredibly simple, so it's not such a big deal.<br /><br />The speaker sounds sharp and clear right up until you hit max volume, at which point it does being to distort somewhat.  Overall, I found the volume level to be impressive.  It won't be enough for a raging party, but it was perfectly adequate for a small get together of 3-4 people, and the music filled the room nicely.  Everyone was impressed that such a small device could produce so much sound.<br /><br />There are of course, better speakers on the market, but they cost significantly more as well.

Creative Labs Nomad Muvo MP3 Player,Electronics,1,"After I wrote this review, I discovered major problems with my Muvo and also a replacement unit: memory corruption that leaves the Muvo dead or files mangled.  <br />You can restore the unit with a special recovery mode hard format with their windows only utility, but this is not documented in their meager documentation.  I found that this was needed every day or two with the units I had.  Since I purchased it for file storage also I returned them both.  <br />That aside after using a Muvo for a couple of weeks, I found: <br />* the lack of a resume where you left off feature to be a major problem (four hours of music in a 128MB unit and you have to keep listening to the first half hour over and over ...).  <br />* you have to reformat and load all files in correct order if you want to control the play order. <br />My original review follows:<br />Rather than the 64, the Muvo 128 makes for a better value.<br />I've upgraded from one of the original Rio 300's so having 121 MB of memory to play with is a blast. Not being locked in to Windows was a big motivation for wanting a device with standard USB storage, plus there's plenty of room to keep your crypto keys and other files. <br />* Windows 2k shows about 121MB (not 128) free on my unit to start. There is a windows specific program for formating the drive. I suspect it puts a copy of the system software in the flash memory somewhere in the missing space. If so then it should be possible to update the firmware on the device a real plus. <br />* The player doesn't play files placed in a subdirectory. Your mp3 files need to be in the root directory. The play order seems to be the physical storage order on the flash memory disk - not alphabetical. <br />* The sound quality sounds great especially with my Sony Fontopia EX70LP ear buds - occasionally almost too much bass.

Now on to the pros and cons... <br /> <br />Pros:  <br />-Small size (not much bigger than the 1 AA battery that powers it) <br />-Screen that holds a lot of information in such a small space (HUGE PLUS over the Ipod Shuffle!)...also has a great backlight for night usage <br />-Battery life - 40+ hours on one AA battery <br />-Very easy to load songs onto it...just plug it into the USB port on your computer and use Windows Explorer...no special software needed (though it does come with a CD that is optional) <br /> <br />Cons: <br /> <br />- Slightly awkward controls...if you want to use the controls one handed, I found it much easier to do it if your holding the unit in your left hand, despite me being a righty, but if you have really big hands it might be hard to move the joystick control...also it is very easy to inadvertently press buttons or move the stick, though there is a \\""Hold\\"" feature that locks out all the controls which helps...",0.9695,positive

Mediabridge Banana Plugs - Corrosion-Resistant 24K Gold-Plated Connectors - 6 Pair/12 Banana Plugs (Part# SPC-BP2-6 ),Electronics,5,"Somehow I have never heard of this company until just last month. I was putting together a new audio system, and picked up some 14 gauge wire off Amazon made by Mediabridge. When I got it I flipped through the brochure and found the company's statement regarding being dedicated to quality at reasonable prices. I'll admit, I rolled my eyes thinking it was just more marketing speak. But after using the cables (including resistance and inductance measurements), I was impressed.<br /><br />What I was less impressed with were the big-name banana plugs I had bought to terminate the cables. So, I figured I would try out the Mediabridge version and see if the speaker cable was a quality fluke. I'm happy to say I was not disappointed. Compared to the big-name banana plugs I got, well, there really is no comparison. As with the cables, I measured resistance/capacitance/inductance on the wires after having the banana plugs installed, and also measured resistance directly at my speakers and then with the Mediabridge banana plugs/wires connected, and am very pleased with the results. This company is now on my go-to list for quality products.<br /><br />Included photo shows plugs while using aforementioned 14 gauge wire. As you can see, they have plenty of space left if you wanted to run bigger wiring.",0.9616,positive

I just started commuting to work by bike--just a 7 mile run round trip, but I dearly missed listening to my local NPR station in the morning and evening. I knew if I were going to get a radio to put on my bike it would need to be small, lightweight, have a great speaker system, and enough FM sensitivity to pick up the NPR station out of Akron (about 20 miles away). This radio fits the bill perfectly!!! The radio itself is about the size of a smart phone and just twice as thick. The digital tuning is awesome, and the sound quality of the speaker blew me away. I plan to fashion a mount for the front of my bike to keep the radio on, but right now I just clip it to my rear bike basket (using the included pocket clip attachment) and hear everything just fine in low to moderate traffic. This radio is simply wonderful for my needs and has greatly improved my daily commute.",0.9931,positive

Apple iPod nano 4 GB Pink,Electronics,3,"After exhausting research and sound testing, I purchased speakers, only recently, for the Nano (perhaps the best available portable speakers now, Altec-Lansing InMotion IM7) and the new improved, second generation Nano will not securely fit into the dock of these beautiful speakers! Why did Apple feel the need to move the docking and headphone jacks? Whatever happened to backwards compatability in electronics? The Nano will fit but  only if you don't use the supplied Nano adapter which holds it snug in it's dock. It will now have to sit loosely while docked and so there goes my portability with this system and lose one of it's many/best features that made the IM7 a solid choice over the Bose and the Apple Hi-Fi. I hope  Altec dsigns a new adapter for this generation Nano. I suppose I have to buy new Apple speakers/Dock made just for this unit. That is until the 3rd generation of Nano comes along that won't fit in the second generation designed speaker/dock accessories. What a joke! I am in the process of trying to cancel my order for the Nano before they engrave it. Originally I wanted the Sandisk Sansa e270 because it had more memory, bigger screen, will play video and pictures, not to mention FM radio and additional 2GB storage via SD memory disk and easy user battery change. It was also considerably cheaper. But... It would only play on my InMotion speakers by using the aux in cable... so I balked on the Sansa  opting for the Nano's docking ability instead. So much for that. Goodbye Nano, Hello Sansa.",0.9572,positive

Creative MuVo TX FM 1 GB MP3 Player,Electronics,5,"One battery on this little thing lasts about 2 days with 8 hour play time each day.  The system is user friendly, and the USB socket is pretty much recognized by all computers without any necessary installation.   <br /> <br />I transferred files by just drag and drop.  Can't be any simpler than that.  No softwares necessary for the MP3's.  Which is great compared to IPOD and the ITUNE stuff.     <br /> <br />I have accidentally dropped this a few times while exercising, but since this thing has no MOVING PARTS (such as a hardrive), unlike the medium size Zen, IPOD Mini or anything else like that, it didn't break.  (I accidentally, broke my IPOD mini when I was exiting my car.)  I think this MuVo is even more indestructable than a cell phone.   <br /> <br />I take this to my car and home.  Works great.  Sounds pretty good if you plug it into your home stereo system or car stereo system.  The key is to turn the MuVo's volume down to save battery while turning up the volume on the interface equipment. <br /> <br />One down side is that when the battery is about to run out, the songs start skipping lyrics.  That's a good indication of when to change the battery. <br /> <br />",0.9786,positive

I was provided a free sample.<br /><br />OK, I was extremely skeptical that these would amount to much. But I have to tell you that they turned my Apple earbuds, that constantly fell out of my ears, into earbuds that not only stay in my ears now, but sound better too.<br /><br />These are very soft silicone and fit very comfortably in my ears. The silicone also makes these more grippy in my ears and my earbuds no longer continually fall out of my ears during activity.<br /><br />Not only do they fit better, they have added a small measure of passive ambient noise reduction and marginally improved the bass that I perceive.<br /><br />So my earbuds fit better, are more comfortable, don't slip, have better ambient noise reduction and have improved the sound characteristics. I'd say that makes these a product to consider. I do think these are priced a bit on the high side, but thats for you to decide and I have not factored price into my rating.",0.9889,positive

If you want a good sounding speaker you would be served getting a shelf system that you can dock into.  Or if a shelf system is not what you want then look into the Samsung line of tube amp/speakers airplay systems, at least the sound is more natural and warm sounding.  Quite frankly I haven't heard any of the small airplay systems to sound very good, the Samsung at least is a bit better than the others I've listened to, and looks to be built better than others, but I'm use to full size speakers and not little puny speakers.",0.8401,positive

JBuds J2 Premium Hi-FI Noise Isolating Earbuds Style Headphones (Onyx Black) (Discontinued by Manufacturer),Electronics,4,"There's no such thing as a pair of earbuds perfectly suited to every pair of ears and every type of music. Your mileage will always vary. So let's focus in on what these buds bring to the table, even in light of them being two product revisions behind on the JBuds evolutionary ladder.<br /><br />The buds are well made, as is to be expected of a JLab product, though they're not quite up to the epic, over-the-top build quality of their J3 and J4 successors. I feel confident they'll hold up to the rigors of basic use without a problem, but they're merely 'very good' buildwise -- the later revisions of the JBuds line are positively epic in this respect. They're also a bit heavier than their J3 successors, and the weight makes them less 'invisible' in the ears than the light-and-tight J3s. The J4s are definitely an improvement here in balance and weight, and an epic step forward in durability, but the J2s aren't bad in any of these respects.<br /><br />The sound is rich, a more balanced midpoint between analog creaminess and the crisp, lucid digital clarity that is the JBuds line's hallmark. The middle frequency boost skews lower than the J3s, making melodic bass warmer and fuller, emphasizing the bottom end of guitar and scooping the mids a little. The shimmering separated clarity of the J3s is absent here, but that's not necessarily a bad thing -- a more blended, less sparkly sound makes the complex soundscapes of synth rock, busy classical passages, and prog-rock melt together a bit, but this is very much a matter of personal taste. Treble fans will definitely want to skip these and beeline to the J3s, but those who found them too trebly and miss the warmth and fullness on the bottom end -- yes, I like big bass, and I cannot lie -- but find the J4s' higher price point daunting may want to check these out instead.<br /><br />For those who argue that the J2s don't have adequate midrange sparkle, listen to Duran Duran's \\""Lonely In Your Nightmare,\\"" and listen to what these buds do to the little chorus guitar licks. It's not as bright as the J3s or even the J4s, but it's still there and it's still satisfying.<br /><br />I've heard better sound from other manufacturers' earbuds, yes, but not until the price quadrupled (or more). In the sub-$50 range, the JBuds line offers fantastic value for the money, and I heartily recommend all of them. If you like treble, or need a really light set of buds, try the J3s, and if you'd like a bassier sound but don't want to jump up to the J4's price point, these J2s are likely for you.<br /><br />Still, if you're don't mind jumping to $40-$50, the J4s are definitely the best of breed, and I think you'll be even happier with them. These J2s are a very respectable budget younger sibling of them, and if you don't mind the slight compromises in durability, balance, weight and sparkle, this bids are definitely strong contenders in the $20 range.<br /><br />Another great job, JLab, but your masterpiece is definitely the J4s!e buds do to the little chorus guitar licks.

Bose® OE2 audio headphones,Electronics,5,"As an owner of 2 pairs of Dre Monster Beats (Studio and Solo, a pair of Fanny Wang's, and numerous mid-to high ear buds, I wanted to try a different brand with a different look, a different feel and a different sound. In large part, I chose the Bose based upon name recognition/reputation and the fact that they looked very comfortable. I can't say enough about the pillowy feel of the ear pads. You could literally wear these all day and not suffer any ear soreness or fatigue. The sound is good. I'm not, nor do I claim to be, an audiophile but I'm satisfied with the seemingly balanced sound emitted from the headphones. If I have any misgivings about the OE2i's its that them seem a bit fragile as compared to the Monster's. I would not feel comfortable folding them up, putting them in a jacket pocket and forgetting about them (without the case). If anyone, except maybe a child, sat or leaned on these things- game over! Overall, these are good commuter headphones- whether it be on airplanes, buses or trains. If you want an over ear headphone for a more active lifestyle, look elsewhere.",0.9246,positive

Logitech Harmony 550 Remotes,Electronics,5,"After unsuccessful experiences with other lesser universal remotes, I was hesitant to give this a try. I've only had it a few days, but so far I'm very impressed. The setup was completely painless; I connected the remote to my PC via USB, inserted the CD, and the software came up with no problems. It was able to identify all the devices in my setup, including such weird ones as the Roku IP music player, and the off-brand set-top box. Profiles for different activities were easy to set up too; eg. when setting up DVD playback the software asked whether I wanted to control volume via the Stereo or DVD player.     The biggest challenge with these things is that when they send commands, they have no way of knowing whether the commands were seen by the components, and so the remote can get out of 'sync'. The unit lets you identify this situation and correct it, by walking through a series of menus. But if you keep the remote pointed in the right direction, this won't happen.    The only downside of this unit is that it seems a bit fragile - I suspect if it gets dropped a few times, or sat on, it will be gone. So I'll do my best to take care of it. Bottom line - go for it.",0.9495,positive

The plastic piece is to be plugged into the bottom hole of the bottom electrical outlet.  However, I have no place for the screw, and the plastic prong did not line up correctly.<br /><br />My solution: Take out the screw (easy) and cut off the plastic piece (not as easy).  This modification means I can now plug the surge protector into my existing outlets; it now works!

Tivoli Audio MSYBLK Music System Digital AM/FM/CD Hi Fi System with Black Ash Finish (Discontinued by Manufacturer),Electronics,4,"Tivoli either doesn't plan to sell many of these or will have to come down on the price--not that it's necessarily overpriced.  As a musician, reviewer, and constant listener I can attest that the Tivoli engineers' \\""tuning\\"" of the sound leaves little to be desired.  Evenness across the sonic spectrum, balance,  \\""tightness,\\"" crispness, fullness, richness, naturalness and presence--more in evidence than ever.  It's not a sound that's likely to cause heads to turn the first time you hear it--Tivoli doesn't go in for the artificial effects, echoey and overly spacious synthesized sounds.  If you want a lot of stereo separation, save some money and pick up the Tivoli Model Two with the satellite speaker plus CD deck.  If you want to feel to rumble, add Tivoli's sub-woofer.  But if you simply want great, reliable, true sound in a small package, this is quality all the way.<br /><br />A couple of minor annoyances:  the many little buttons on the machine go against Tivoli's tradition of simplicity as well as occasionally strain my patience (especially when I'm using sources other than CD).  Also, the CD will occasionally appear to jam.  The solution is to disconnect and reconnect the electrical cord.",0.9399,positive

This was as close as I could come.<br /><br />PROS:<br />* You can plug in 6 large power bricks at the same time without issue.<br />* The power switch is well protected from accidental cycling, an extremely common issue with top mounted power switches.<br />* A flat power cable end to hug up against the wall if you need to install it behind furniture.<br />* Fairly inexpensive for all of the usable outlets it provides.<br /><br />CONS:<br />* It's very large in both length and width. It may or may not fit in a guitar FX pedal board soft bag, particularly if you leave the power bricks installed.<br />* Has a weirdly angled molded 3 prong cable end which can make it challenging to plug into outlets with other weird cable ends.<br />* It has enough physical size it seems they could've designed it to accommodate 8 power bricks, but that last outlet is too close to the adjacent outlet as well as the raised portion of the chassis.<br /><br />I ended up purchasing two",0.614,positive
Timex T065S Solar Powered Radio Controlled Atomic Alarm Clock (Discontinued by Manufacturer),Electronics,5,"I bought two of these to replace our two Timex bedside clock radios. Whenever there was a power failure, the time would drift on the backup batteries so eventually they displayed different and incorrect times. They also had to be adjusted twice a year between Daylight Saving Time and Standard Time. We grew tired of this.    I searched far and wide for a radio-controlled alarm clock with an amber LED back-lit display that stays illuminated all of the time. I was unable to find any. This clock is close. It has an amber LED back-lit display that illuminates for a few seconds when the snooze bar is pressed. The alarm is fairly loud and progressively beeps more the longer it alarms, a good feature. However, if the snooze bar is not pressed, the alarm stops and does not beep again for another 24 hours.    The best part, though, is that the clock never has to be set, is always correct, and automatically changes between Standard and Daylight Saving Time.",-0.552,negative

SOUL by Ludacris SL300 High Definition Noise Canceling Headphones,Electronics,4,"Though I usually spend hours listening to music (mainly while programming), until now I've never had a pair of headphones that cost more than $25, simply because I had more important things to put my money on. When I saw the price drop on this product (~$170 to $70) I decided to go out of my budget a little. I wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />Long story short, those are the best headphones you can get for $70. Some people said that they have low mids, which gives a &#34;echoing voice&#34; feeling. Well, I've compared it to my friend's $120 Sennheisers and didn't notice this effect. In the other hand, yes, they leak a considerable amount of audio. A person at your side could easily tell which song you are listening to, even in a middle range volume.<br /><br />The noise cancelling part was awesome. It makes the music sound just perfect. People had to touch my arm to get my attention, because I wouldn't hear them even in a medium level volume. Now I think: &#34;how could I live without this for so long?&#34;. Of course, I couldn't compare this to my friend's $300 Bose noise cancelling ear buds, but for $70 it is incredible. The overall music quality is just really good for its category (artist branded over the ear headphones): very close to a beats studio, in my opinion.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you have $170, save some more and buy a decent pair of Bose. If you can find these for $70 and that's the highest you can pay for some comforting and decent listening (did I mention that they feel so comfy you can easily forget they are around your head?), then you should totally buy these.",0.9717,positive

Day in, day out - I travel on the trains or buses to get to work and a good set of headphones is the most important thing for me to make my everyday journey bearable. Would you believe if I told you that I have over 6 pair of headphones from various companies lying around, some more expensive than others. My biggest problem with in ear headphones is that after a short period of moving around with them, they can lose their grip with your ear canal and start to slide out bit by bit (maybe it is my ear??). This lets the outside noise creep in and spoils the whole experience.    Enter the realm where the voices are crisp and clear, the base thumpy and the earphones never lose their snug fit once you insert them into your ear canal correctly. Logitech's UE SuperFi 5 Pro headphones are the best. I can't recommend them enough even though their price is a bit on the high side. Once you buy these, you will not want to buy another set of headphones. EVER! Even the cord is made out of strong material to withstand bends, turns etc. so the last longer and provide more bang for your buck.    If you are buying these, I don't think I have to let you know that all the professional singers, musicians etc. use this particular brand of headphones. Now, that says something. Go ahead, treat yourself and buy a pair! I guarantee that you will be JUMPING WITH JOY when listening to your music ;-)",0.967,positive

Pioneer SC-1323-K 7.2-Channel Network Receiver,Electronics,4,"I got a great deal on this reciever through the Amazon Wharehouse ($400).  It absolutely blows the old Integra reciever it replaced away (which I got rid of because of lack of HDMI input/output).  It does do 3D passthrough without a hitch.  My TV is just under 4K and everything had gone through on the video side without any issues.  I am using all 9 amplified channels at times, 7 for surround sound a two speakers in an adjoining \\""poker' room at times as Speaker B when we're streaming pandora while playing cards.  I have not been able to figure out how to adjust volumes on speaker A versus B separately.  I initially also had an amp for the \\""poker\\"" room and could not for the life of me figure out how to use Zone 2 for the sound output and I am not sure if I am just too dense to understand the complicated manual and set up menu or if something is wrong with my amp (there may be so this might not be the receiver's fault).  Also, while the reciever can play Pandora, it seems to have interruptions to the stream much more than if I play Pandora on my iPhone and use Airplay to stream.  So bottom line is performance wise this is 5 stars (other than the Pandora streaming issue) and figuring out the unfortunately not included 200 page manual is like trying to study greek.  I really think they should at least include a simple language quick start guide in actual paper.  It's also horribly awkward to try to enter text for your username/password for Pandora and the entire user interface is just poorly designed in my opinion, even for a receiver.",-0.2874,negative
Koss Porta Pro On Ear Headphones with Case,Electronics,1,"I guess I was expecting too much. They are very small, at least compared to what I thought they'd be. I can barley get them to fit my big head. I have a $4 pair of Koss headphones that are more comfortable and fit better. They sound like garbage. Yeah, they have bass, but it sounds muffled. Where are the highs and mids. Middle range sound is most important in my book and these headphones have a terrible mid range. Bass is good for irritating you after a while and helping you get hearing damage. The reviews on this product make me wonder if these people have ever tried on a good pair of headphones, not just bass headphones.<br />I'm done buying headphones that I don't try on first. $40 in the toilet.",0.7856,positive

Atlantic 74735681 Summit Media Storage Cabinet (Maple) (Discontinued by Manufacturer),Electronics,5,"If you have a decent amount of DVDs and/or Blu-rays and just want something plain to store them in, this is an excellent choice. It's not too fancy, sure, but that's not really its point. It's also rated for CDs but, well, I don't have any, but I'm sure it'd work for those as well. It's less deep than I thought, but it's sufficient -- most DVDs will go against the back of the cabinet and will go all the way up to the end of the shelf. Some will go a little over and some will go a little under, but it's nothing to worry about. I would have liked maybe another half-inch, but it's no reason to not buy it. The unit includes six shelves that can be placed in adjustable locations (in addition to the two shelves and the bottom of the unit, which cannot be moved). This gives you a potential 9 shelves for storage, but if you want all 9, the height is limited to about that of a CD. If you want to fit DVDs, you'll only be putting in 3 of the adjustable shelves, giving you a total of 6 shelves.<br /><br />As for putting it together, it's very simple and the instructions are very clear. All of my parts were in excellent condition and everything fit as it should. The cabinet requires a Phillips head screwdriver and a hammer (neither is included) to put it together, though the hammer is only used for the 34 small nails to secure the cardboard backing to the wood.<br /><br />It's clear looking in the pictures now, but I couldn't tell beforehand -- the very bottom of the cabinet extends out from the unit, most likely for potential balancing issue. The unit also includes a couple of brackets to secure it to the wall, but unless you have small children, I don't think this is necessary.<br /><br />So all in all, you can see what you're getting, but you're also getting what appears to be excellent quality and simple construction, especially for the price.",0.9937,positive
Clip Plus 4 GB MP3 Player (Black),Electronics,2,First let me say I have bought at least 25 of these during the past 10 years and the quality used to really impress me. I have sent a couple through the washing machine (some years ago) and had them work flawlessly with a little time to dry off.  This latest purchase though has me convinced I won't buy another. I have found on a popular auction site I can still get the Creative Zen Stone for about the same amount. I won't bother with these again.  I wore it on a walk in the rain and got it a tad damp and it stopped working entirely; compare that to having them work flawlessly after a couple washes I am pretty sure as with all other devices these have deteriorated in quality.

JBuds Rugged Metal In-Ear Earbuds Style Headphones with Travel Case,Electronics,4,"I've had this for a year now, and the sound quality is great. They look pretty awesome too, many people confuse it for beats. Iff your ears can support the extra large double flange tips (they give you 7 sets!), try it out-the bass is unbelievable. Compared to my skullcandy's and sony's, this is a big step up. It also comes with this nifty case, though I don't really use it much. I would use it if only it was a bit bigger or if I had a smaller mp3 player, but my iPod touch can't fit in it, so there's really no use for me to use that case.<br /><br />However, it's not as durable as you would think-it looks really strong, with the thick wires and stuff, but mine lasted for around half a year before one side went out. However, JLab's customer service is awesome, and they replaced it hassle free. This is much better than skullcandy, where you have to send in your old pair in exchange for a new one, and it's one of the reasons I pick JLab.<br /><br />There is one flaw with this headphone though: it's heavy. Probably because of all the reinforcements they added to the wire. That's why there's plenty of people complaining about the earbuds falling out. They do include a clip though, and if you clip it on right, it takes the weight off and gives it more support.",0.9771,positive

Logitech Harmony 1100 Universal Remote with Color Touch Screen (Discontinued by Manufacturer),Electronics,4,"The strongest feature about this remote is its ability to be upgraded.  While many universal remotes that are coming out tote this type of feature, Logitech is a brand that really stays on top of things and they even allow you to configure a remote manually to the harmony if it isn't in their database.  The touch screen and activities you can program (play a game, watch a dvd, etc) really make working your home theater system a snap.  It does most things by itself and asks very simple questions to get the activities customized.  The look and feel of the remote really ring true with how a remote should fit in your hands.  It's just great to use and the backlighting makes it wonderful in a dark room.    But, there are areas I feel it could do better in.  As great as it is with keeping up to date on devices, it would be nice if you didn't have to plug it in to the PC every time you wanted to modify or add a device/activity.  Also, I wish there were a better way of providing the buttons of a particular remote visually.  For instance, some universals actually mimic the display of the remote you are controlling where as the Harmony 1100 simply displays all of the available inputs in pages of 9 buttons, showing them alphabetically.  I still have to play with it more to see how much customizing you can do with each device interface, but from what I can tell, you're kind of stuck with dealing with the pages of buttons.  However, I did notice that on particular models like a DVD player or PS3 player, it has a simple interface of movie controls (play, pause, ffd/rev, etc) so that is a plus.  Also, for as much money as you sink into this thing, it would be amazing to have a hybrid unit that does Bluetooth and/or RF as well as IR considering how prevalent these signals are becoming in modern electronics.  Perhaps in the next model...  Also, it does stink a bit to have to wait for each device to turn on in order before you can put the remote down.  The only way to really get around this is to have a different type of input (Bluetooth, RF) or rig up some type of IR relay that passes the signals to a switch system.  But that goes outside the simple setup they have going.    Bottom Line: Aside from these few short comings, the remote performs as expected and definitely does what it's supposed to.  Also, if you are into tinkering and adding IR receivers to things, it certainly will work.  For instance I plan on incorporating one into my bass shaker amp for the transducers I have attached to my living room furniture.",0.995,positive

The only con I have about it is that the only way to charge it is through the sync cable it came with. It is hard for it to get a full charge through your usb port on your computer, but that is easily fixed with the belkin charging kit which is only a little over $20. I recommend getting that if you are planning on buying the view. I would definitely recommend the view to anyone looking for a quality mp3 player at a great price.

Soundcast ICO-411 Outcast (Grey) (Discontinued by Manufacturer),Electronics,5,"I was skeptical at spending this type of $$$ for speakers but I was looking for something I could use in multiple venues, wireless and had good sound quality.

The sound quality has remained constantly impressive even while I use this piece in my garage which is >100' away from the transmitter (Included).  I have not tested the 350 avertised range but have not needed to go this far.  Also, the battery life is excellent.  I have not tested the 10 hour advertised rate, but have used the Outcast at a loud level poolside for ~7 hours without any fade to volume or sound quality.

AC Adapter Charger for Apple Powerbook and iBook 65 Watt,Electronics,1,"I thought that I would save a little money and buy this for my 15 inch PowerBook. It was a major mistake.    Pros:  - Less expensive than the Apple and the Macally cords.  - Sturdier piece that plugs into the computer than the Apple cord.    Cons:  - Constant high pitched noise whenever plugged into an electricity source.  - Occasionally gets too hot to touch, and otherwise it's always very warm when the cord is plugged in.  - Connector to the powerbox has gotten very loose the more the cord has been moved.  - Connector to the computer got very loose very fast; pulls out easily, you have to twist it around and push up on the piece to make it work (I usually use something like a stapler to hold it in place).     Overall:  - This cord is awful. Don't waste your money on it. Go for the Macally (or Apple).",0.1891,positive

Sony STR-DN1040 7.2-Channel Network A/V Receiver (Built-in Wi-fi & Bluetooth),Electronics,3,"UPDATE:  I bought a Yamaha RX-475,  which I'm reasonably happy with, but also learned that Airplay wasn't working on Sony due to Verizon Actiontec router issues, not the Sony unit.  I'm not so sure about the WiFi part.  The rest of my review still applies--just wanted to make clear that it was a router problem, not Sony problem.<br /><br />THIS PART NO LONGER APPLIES:  [I'm returning this defective unit because neither Airplay or WiFi work], but after spending a few days with it, here's my observations:<br /><br />The Pros:<br />Nice on-screen menus for configuration, very easy set-up<br />Attractive basic black front, clean looking without too many buttons/dials<br />Easily readable front display<br />Very strong clear sound with Bose Setup.<br />No lip sync issues feeding STB input through receiver.<br /><br />The Cons:<br />In spite of nice on-screen menus, configuration options limited:  couldn't remove unused inputs from input selector, couldn't specify that TV is NOT a signal source, etc.<br />Airplay (if it had been working) can auto-start the system, but not auto-power-off.  This seems to be true of other receivers too.<br />No smartphone control for this receiver.  No mention in the instructions of Sony apps for iOS or Android.  In fact for iOS there are at least 3 Sony apps available, but only one of the 3 works with this receiver (for apparently NAS server type of access)<br />Bluetooth, but no keyboard profile.  Would help with set up.<br /><br />Summary:  Like many reviewers here, I bought this to replace a 20-year-old receiver, and for all the bells and whistles, thinking the state of the art has advanced, and I'd have a seamless experience.  However, the \\""state of the receiver\\"" is not as advanced as I had hoped, seems like they are still getting into the the user interface/software age.  For instance, although some streaming audio options are available, Airplay mirroring for video, Netflix, Hulu are not options.  And as noted, my particular receiver didn't have a functioning control app.  I'm going to go a little lower in price point to Yamaha RX-V475 next;  just need 5.1 and Airplay.  No point in future-proofing with 7.2 etc when there may be much improved models available in the future!<br /><br />Side note:  HDMI-CEC, is a nice idea for simplified remote control in theory, but your STB may not support it, and Apple TV and Roku box don't either, so it's not quite a universal thing (yet).  Just don't count on seamless experience.",0.9833,positive

Then, suddenly, it stopped working when I put the iPod on dock (it charges on the dock).  IT does work with a cable, but a partially working set of speakers is not satisfactory.<br /><br />I found it hard to put the iPod on the dock.  It would take about 30 seconds to connect it properly and I wonder if the dock somehow damaged my iPod?  It doesn't seem to fit properly.  I also found lots of comments about this issue on the internet.<br /><br />I already have packaged up these speakers to return them.  They need to be redesigned and tested with real users before they are ready for sale.  A good idea--just not there yet.  And the whole dock mechanism needs to be rethought--its angle, the ability to connect with it quickly and easily and the fact that many people say on line that it has damaged the connection in their iPod.<br /><br />I am very disappointed that this product did not work well with my iPod touch.",-0.7667,negative

iHome IH70 Computer Stereo Speaker System with Dock for iPod (Silver),Electronics,5,"The product is great.  However, service was a problem.  I had this shipped overnight; paying an extra $30 and when I received it everything was not in the box (new box and packaging).  The cord that connects the speaker together was missing.  I call Amazon customer service and talked to someone who talked very poor English and lack people skills, seem to be reading procedure from a book.  He had no personality and was not very sympathetic.  He said I had to call the manufacture.  I knew this was a problem since I did not buy it direct from the manufacture.  I called the manufacture and talked to a person who spoke a little better English, but had to get in a little agreement with her.  She told me I had to go through Amazon because that where I purchase it.  Finally she talked to a supervisor or someone and got it approve.  I had to fax over the packing slip showing that I had purchased it from Amazon.  It took about 5 days, including the weekend to resolve the issue.  I not sure it is worth the small saving when the merchant is not responsible for solve issues of items purchase from them.   If I did not have a fax machine, I would have to go locate one in order to fax the receipt and that would have taken my valuable time.  The item is great, but I'm still not comfortable with their customer service.",0.8802,positive

Polk Audio SurroundBar IHT 6000 Instant Home Theater (Black),Electronics,5,"I  was looking for something to improve the sound of the Plasma TV in our family room.  We have a dedicated Home Theater Room  with a high end 7.1 system  in the house but a lot of times my wife prefers to watch movies in the family room if they don't have scenes with the need for full  surround sound.   I did some research and decided that the Polk IHT 6000 seemed to be what I was looking for.  I was able to find an open box unit for considerably less than the $499 list so I bought it.  As has been mentioned in other reviews, set up took less time than it did to get the hardware out of the box.  I used the enclosed toslink cable to connect the TV to the Soundbar.  I hooked the Input 2 to an Apple Airport Express so I can also stream music from iTunes on my computer. I plugged the Subwoofer  in a socket in the corner of my room, it sync'd without an issue.  I did a little tweeking with the sub to get the proper balance and again, that was not a big deal.  The sound is great.  It is clear, and I find I can listen at much lower levels than with the TV speakers and still follow the show. That doesn't mean you can't crank it up, you can.  I also tried playing iTunes and that worked great as well.  I should point out, this will not produce full surround sound like you get with separate side and rear speakers but the sound is truly 3D like.    Some folks report having a problem with wifi.  I have wifi in my house and have not had any problems with it interfering with the speaker or vice versa.  I also would like to comment on the remote programing issues.  I have been using Harmony remotes for a number of years and I highly recommend them.  They are easy to program (for anyone!!!) and they work.  After I ordered the sound I decided to reprogram my remote so that it would be ready. (for those not familiar with Harmony remotes, you program them on you computer then download the info to the remote via a usb cable)  I got into the program, and sure enough, the IHT 6000 was inthe ata base and I was reprogramed in about 10 min.  If your having remote problems, this is the answer.",0.9931,positive

Digital Optical 2 Way Audio Splitter,Electronics,5,I bought this because I use a soundbar and a set of Tritton head phones.  I wanted to use both for audio for the TV (not just have the headphones for just playing Xbox games.)  Unfortunately my TV only has 1 audio out which is optical.<br /><br />I had first purchased a cheap $5 splitter (you've probably seen it already) and of course it didn't work.  I picked this up and within two minutes it was working great.  I have no sound degradation (that I can tell) or volume loss.  The adapter is SMALL (which is good) the power adapter is actually bigger than the unit.  The only thing I dislike is the bright blue light for power on but a piece of electrical tape fixes that fast enough.<br /><br />FYI since cable length is a concern here is my setup:<br /><br />LG 50PV400 w/6ft Optical cable out to splitter &#62; Splitter w/ 3ft optical out to Vizio VHT 510 sound bar &#62; Splitter w/1.5ft optical out to Tritton headphones.,0.7421,positive

Apple iPod touch 32 GB 3rd Generation OLD MODEL,Electronics,4,"I was the anti-iPod guy.  I couldn't stand Apple's ubiquitous iPod, and I was angry that the entire MP3 world was geared around it.  Why?  Because I hated iTunes.  I bought an iRiver H320 years ago because while you could use included software to transfer files, it also operated as an external hard drive with drag and drop functionality.  This was really great in 2004 when portable hard drives weren't quite as popular or small or cheap!  What I liked best about it, though, was that I didn't interfere with the way my music was organized on my computer.  Oh, and when I had tried iTunes in 2004, it locked up my PC...    Flash forward to today.  I love the iPod Touch!  After watching the iPhone App Store grow exponentially, I really wanted an iPhone, but alas Verizon is the carrier of choice at my work.  The iPhone Touch offered many of the same pluses as the iPhone, though, so I chose it over the iPod Classic and couldn't be happier.  The number of free applications is mind boggling, and the web browser (over wifi) is actually much easier to use and responsive than you might think.  Most importantly, there isn't a better touch screen out there.  I have an Archos Series 5 touchscreen internet tablet, and it's not even in the same league as the iPod Touch.    While the Touch still requires iTunes, it has really come a long way.  Playing nice with PCs, it no longer frustrates me like it used to.  I still loathe the \\""security\\"" that prevents you from pulling music off of your Touch onto another \\""authorized\\"" computer.  I realize the intention, but it's just obnoxious.  What's nice, though, is the flexibility that iTunes affords different types of users.  Your iPod will automatically sync all of the music, movies, and applications on your machine if you want.  This is great for someone who has a limited library and wants to ensure all music is on the device.  I, on the other hand, have more music than my iPod could hold; so, I can turn off the auto sync function and just manually add what songs or albums I want at any particular time.  Sorting and organization is intuitive as well.    A big knock against iPod/iTunes, however, is limited format support.  You can play .mp3 and .m4a files which covers most music -- .flac users are out of luck -- but video files MUST be h264 .mp4 files.  Have divx or xvid .avi files?  Sorry!  You have to convert them.  This isn't an issue if you plan on downloading everything from iTunes or plan to just now start converting your DVDs for your new iPod.  However, if you're like me and had an Archos for years with almost everything in .avi format, it makes you want to strangle someone at Apple.  For that very reason, I upgraded from my old Archos 504 -- I have a review of it on Amazon as well -- to the new(er) Archos Series 5.  The Archos accepts most everything.  While you have to pay extra for AC3 and .VOB support to import your DVDs directly (no conversion) as well as h264 AVC (720p) and AAC audio, it's at least an option.  I bought the AC3 plugin for my last Archos and will buy it again for my new one ($20).  If the Touch had better video format support, it would be my only device.    To be fair, the Archos Series 5 isn't equivalent competition.  It is a much bigger, much heavier device directed at a different, albeit under the same umbrella, market.  The iPod's main competitor, the new HD Zune, suffers from the same limited format support.  For me, the Touch was a slam dunk easy decision over the Zune even though I've heard great things about the Zune's screen.  5 years ago, I would've never imagined writing a positive review for an iPod, but the 3rd Generation Touch is a winner!",0.998,positive
Sharp CD-XP7700 100-Watt Compact Stereo System,Electronics,5,"I was a little cautious before buying this audio shelf-system as I couldn't find any rating for it either on Amazon.com, or Epinons, or other similar sites.

No fancy bells and whistles, just sharp features and easily operable controls. (I love the blue and black color combination. It is really smart looking.)<BR>Internally the sound is gorgeous, the CD/MP3 player works great, and I like that it has a dual tape-player. The speakers are well-designed also. All in all I'm very pleased with this unit.<BR>The only thing I wish would be better is the remote control. It is a generic gray box (not matching the unit at all; so if you have a bunch of remotes you will have a hard time guessing that this one is for the shelf-system.) It has a zillion tiny buttons - all the same color, shape and design - so to operate it in the dark you will need the eyes of an owl to read the tiny lettering above the tiny buttons, or a good deal of luck to figure out which button you want to use. Even the on/off button and the volume is tiny and the same as the rest. I'm surprized that such a beautifully crafted shelf-system has such a poorly designed remote.<BR>However all the features of the system itself are excellent and I highly recommend it.",0.9977,positive
Sanyo Eneloop NiMH Battery Charger with 4AA NiMH Rechargable Batteries (Discontinued by Manufacturer),Electronics,5,"I don't know what is about these rechargeable batteries, but they work like a dream.  They can sustain a charge for a very long time.  I have been using them in my Cannon digital camera since June and I have not had any difficulty with them whatsoever.  When I first got my camera, I bought some brand name regular digital camera batteries and they lasted all of one week and I found myself buying more and more and just tossing them after a few days or a week.  So, I did my research and discovered the Eneloop.  They charge in a decent amount of time, and the handy charger makes it easy to recharge them.  It's not bulky or flimsy and it comes with a cover.  But I have not found that I need to charge the batteries frequently to get maximum use.  I don't use the camera frequently, but 2-3 times per month to snap pictures of my kid at various events, these batteries have never failed me though.  I tried two other brands of rechargeable batteries, but these are the ones that performed the best. I bought them at a retail store based on reviews I read on Amazon and I needed them right away.  But, the store was practically sold out--I guess I wasn't the only one desperate for Eneloop.  But I eventually found some.

It'll cost $30 to get it replaced with a refurbished unit.<br />- I eventually changed out the earbuds with some Panasonic RPHJE355R.

SoundMAGIC ES18 In-Ear Earphones,Electronics,4,"I'm slightly addicted to earphones. I have about 30-40 pairs, including some pretty expensive ones. Hard to keep track because I also gave many away.

These es18s are more natural sounding and pleasant to listen to. The build quality seems fine, but I've never had a problem with earphones failing. I have many pairs that are several years old and work fine.  These es18 don't have much bass. If you want a lot of bass, try the soundsoul s-018 for $5.99. I was very impressed with them and they have a lot of bass, but also pretty good lyrics. I was switching back and forth between the s-018 and these es18, listening to the same songs many times. The soundsoul s-018 are substantially louder and more powerful sounding than these es18 (obviously the specs mean nothing), so I adjusted the volume to compare more fairly. I thought the s-018 were such a good deal, I bought 5 more for gifts (did I mention they come w/ 5 pairs of good tips and a great case!)  I still recommend these es18 pretty highly because they are fairly priced and decent sound, but I probably won't buy any more, at least at this price.

CREATIVE EP-510 Clip-On Earphones (White),Electronics,5,"I have tried several headphones for working out.  I had given up and thought I found the perfect one in Audio Technica ATH-CP300.  when these started to wear out after a few years of use, I decided to try some new things.  I ordered 2 pairs of these, because for 10$ - why not... I also ordered the Auravana headphones to compare them.  Bottom line, I will continue to use these headphones for working out, and gave the other set to my girlfriend for her to use.  They sounds REALLY good when compared to other 10$ phones and they sound better (to me) than my ATH-CP300's.  The sound is a little flat so the highs aren't as bright but it gives me the bass and low frequency that I really missed from the ATH-CP300's.  This is from a phone that's 1/4 the price as well.<br /><br />They stay in place far better than the AT's and the sound is a little deeper.  Maybe not quite as crisp, but not nearly enough of a difference to bother me.  I do not miss the AT's after a week.<br /><br />Compared to the Auravana's they are not as good.  The Auravana is a superb headphone with the brights highs and crisp with exceptional clarity, I have yet to work out with it though.  The sound is 50$ better than the EP-510's, and I think the EP-510's sound excellent for the money.  I believe I have found a worthy replacement for the old Sony behind the neck head phones.",0.9734,positive

Phottix Varos BG Multi-Function Flash Shoe Umbrella Holder,Electronics,5,"I am enjoying this umbrella adapter. I use speedlights with light modifiers, and the ability to change the stud with hotshoe from straight to 90 degrees is a wonderful option. It allows me to keep my speedlight straight which keeps the light close to the center of the modifier. This position also makes it easier to access the controls on the speedlight. Another nice benefit is that with the speedlight straight, it can be top up or top down and it makes no difference. This makes it easy to attach remote triggers without them getting in the way of the umbrella rod. This umbrella holder is make of metal and is very solid. All knobs and handles are easy to tighten.

Denon AVR1706 7.1 Channel Home Theater Receiver,Electronics,5,"-My dad purchased this amp in 2005 to power his new Bose® Acoustimass® 5 system he got back then. The amp always seemed high end to me. He gave the amp to me for my birthday in 2008 since he wasn't using it. He purchased a Bose 3-2-1 GS system which had its own Amp. His loss in my opinion since this thing sounds great. I had an old 2 channel Sherwood Amp before this one. It was very simple (stereo only, only RCA jacks)and sounded good. The Denon though sounds much better especially once I hooked it up using a Toslink cable. I use it as my music/home theater amp now in my apartment and couldn't be happier. Its only flaw is that its old enough not to have HDMI. Still it sounds very good and has plenty of features to adjust to your liking. Can decode most of the standard 5.1/6.1 surround sound formats except the new loss less HD ones. I have to bit stream DTS/Dolby Digital through the toslink to get all the channels to work [due to toslink/coaxial cable bandwidth limitation], which means the sound is compressed, but I really don't notice the loss in quality. I keep reading that Denon amps have a warm sound to them [mid range is rich/pronounced]. This seems to be true and I like this quality that the amp adds to music. Everything simply sounds great and it will still be a long while before I replace this beauty.<br /><br />[My speakers are: Bose 301 Fronts, JBL Balboa Center, Bose® Acoustimass® 5 rear {same ones I talked about in the beginning of the review ^_-}.][Note: I am not a Bose fan boy, I just happen to have Bose speakers because that is what my family has given to me in the past.

"Infinity Primus Two-way 4-Inch Bookshelf/Satellite Speaker (Black, Each)",Electronics,5,The sound quality is excellent. Actually my wife likes the sound better than my floor model JBL speakers.

They were picked to fit above the trim on a door so size was a limit. Also the whole installation replaced a Bose Wave radio. No comparison.

Skullcandy Hesh Over-Ear Headphone,Electronics,1,"Don't buy these unless you can get them for $5. I wouldn't spend more than that on them. I bought these and returned them within 10 minutes for better headphones. They sound distant and lacking, like the sound is coming from another room instead of from headphones. They also do terribly on trebble and are mainly midrange with some bass. They aren'y particularly loud headphones ether, nor are they good enough quality to be worth $50. You can get some great pairs of headphones in the %50-60 range (Sony MDR-XB500 being my personal favorite) and these are not one of those. I am an audio professional and have used several pairs of headphones for various uses. I was planning on getting a pair of these for use while walking for listening to music because I figured they would be loud, but the terribly balanced sound coupled with low power handling make these not only sound bad when they're at low volume levels, but become even more distorted at higher ones. They have worse sound quality than the $3 colby headphones you can get. These I used to wonder why people thought Monster Cable made the best headphones but comparing them to these beats sound phenominal, but Beats also only have the overall quality of about $50-75 worth. Bottom line is I would not suggest these headphones, nor any headphones made by Skullcandy. I also suggest against Monster Cable's audio gear. Go out and get yourself some SOny MDR-XB500's, or save up for the XB1000s or some Sennheisers or Sure or any of the other actual audio companies. Don't get these. Ignore the people saying they're great because they haven't used any other headphones in that price range. Also steer clear of Bose as they are just as terribly overpriced.",0.9071,positive

Elivebuy surge protector and usb charging station,Electronics,5,"I was give this item to test and review.  This is my opinion:<br /><br />This is a nice-looking power strip that includes 5 USB 5v charging ports.  It has both 1A and 2.4A ports (although you can charge any 5v device in either one).  The 2.4A ports will just charge quicker your larger devices that draw more power, like tablets, etc. but you can still charge them on the 1A port as well.  This power center is rated at 10A 250v, so overall, it is rated for 2500W.  I would use it for low-draw items like lighting, computers, speakers, chargers, etc.  I don't think it would work too well for high-draw things like multiple heaters, blow-dryers, etc.<br /><br />Just one concern -- the 120v outlets are 'facing' each other, meaning the ground pin is toward the middle on all outlets.  So if you had wall wart chargers or large plugs, they may not fit together across from each other.",0.8757,positive

Apple iPod Video 60 GB (5th Generation) OLD MODEL,Electronics,5,"Well, I became the last person on my block to get an iPod.  I had been thinking about getting one since the third generation ones came out, came very close on two or three occasions, and finally took the plunge.  I toyed with getting one of the smaller iPods to start off, but because I have a very large music collection, I decided to go ahead and get the 60 GB.  I'm glad that I did.  After putting all of the music that I considered \\""basic\\"" I had used up 47 of the 56 GBs of usable memory.  I can pare that down by deleting extra cuts (for instance, I have both original albums and greatest hits collections, and I don't need Dylan cuts from both HIGHWY 61 REVISITED and BIOGRAPH).  I haven't put a great deal of video.  I have a bit and found that the quality is surprisingly good, but I personally would rather listen to a Schubert string quartet and read than watch a video.  I have about a dozen audio books that I got from Audible (though for some reason my computer often crashes when I download after installing the Audible plug in for iTunes), four or five episodes of TV shows formatted for iPod, a couple of podcasts (Damon Lindelhof and Carlton Cuse on LOST and Ricky Gervais and Steve Merchant's bizarre conversations), a single movie (STEWIE GRIFFIN: THE UNTOLD STORY, which I keep mainly for demonstration purposes for friends), and several hundred albums in addition to a few hundred individual songs.  All in all, I can carry quite a cultural library around with me.<br /><br />I chose to get a DLO leather portfolio to protect my iPod.  I am not sure if it is sold over Amazon, but it is readily available at Best Buy.  It is black so it goes well with the black iPod.  I haven't gotten a cover for the video screen yet, but I can tell I will need to.  I'm really hesitant to wipe the screen I'm so paranoid about scratching it.  No one, of course, should even remotely consider not getting a case to protect it.<br /><br />So far I haven't come even remotely close to running out of the battery, even when I have watched a video.  If I keep it playing on music without switching songs I find the battery barely goes down at all.<br /><br />As a complete newbie I was a bit worried that importing music was going to be a problem.  I had already cleared 60 GB of empty space on my second hard drive.  It was, however, remarkably easy to learn to do.  I'm now working on fine tuning my selections.  For instance, some CDs import with the name of slightly different than others.  One album can list the artist as \\""The Rolling Stones\\"" while another is \\""Rolling Stones,\\"" which can separate the album listings in the menu.  So, there is a lot of fine tuning, but the main importing is straightforward.  It is, however, SLOW WORK.  I had stacks and stacks and stacks of CDs laying for days around my computer as I imported one CD after another.<br /><br />Even though I have had my iPod for only a short time, it has already become an indispensable part of my life.  I absolutely love having hundreds of albums and thousands of songs at my beck and call.  Gradually I may come to use the other media as much as the music, but even if I never use it for anything other than listening to music, this was a purchase I absolutely do not regret in the least.  I will say that if you aren't a compulsive collector of music and don't have at least a thousand or so CDs, you will probably be happier with a smaller iPod, like the Mini or the Nano.  But for fellow music junkies, I give this a big thumb up.ng out of the battery, even when I have watched a video.

VideoSecu Full Motion Articulating Tilt TV Wall Mount Bracket,Electronics,5,"This articulating arm is an excellent product.  Packed within the box are all the necessary screws and bolts - including plastic wall anchors - that you should need.  I used this to mount a 21 inch monitor to my workbench wall.  Total time to mount (after deciding where to mount it) took no longer than 10 minutes.  Once mounted to the wall, it had a very solid feeling and I feel very confident that there will be no issues with using the monitor on a daily basis.  While the contents do include a couple of plastic wall anchors for mounting this to a standard drywall, I would not recommend this as I can easily see those plastic anchors working loose very quickly especially if the monitor is extended, thereby compromising the mount.  I suggest either mounting the unit directly to a wall stud or purchasing a more secure bolt for mounting directly in hollow drywall.

ClearStream 5 Indoor/Outdoor HDTV Antenna - 65 Mile Range,Electronics,4,"After some initial confusion, I'm pretty happy with this antenna. It's sold as a VHF/UHF antenna, and can be used as such, but when it arrived and I read the instructions I got the definite impression that it's a VHF-only antenna. Using it for both gave me worse reception on most channels than I was getting with my old storm-damaged Channel Master, so I was more than a little disappointed. Worse, it appeared to offer no improvement at all on the one VHF channel in my area (Chanel 8 Indianapolis) which I could still pull in (post-storm) on one TV but no longer could on the other. However, there's a happy ending to this story. Currently I'm using the included VHF/UHF diplexer and using the mostly undamaged UHF portions of my old antenna with the C5 for VHF, and I'm getting all the stations I could reasonably expect to get in my rural area.<br />Now here's the cautionary tale: One of the critical differences with the new DTV system verses the old analogue system is that TV stations are now all virtual in the sense that they advertise one channel (quite typically a VHF channel like 6 or 13) but actually broadcast on another (usually a UHF channel). A not so obvious consequence of this is that you can't just &#34;point&#34; your TV at a particular channel anymore, hence the constant admonition to rescan for channels every time you make a change. Somewhere along the line my TV forgot where channel 8 was broadcasting (actually channel 9 in this case I think) so even with the new antenna I still wasn't getting it. However, once I realized this possibility and rescanned, the TV found it and all was right with the universe again.",-0.7589,negative

Just keep a proportion in mind and undoubtedly you will enjoy this product.<br /><br />I've found on these \\""little giants\\"" a fantastic solution. I never use them at the highest volume because that isn't really the purpose of speakers of this size (however they're capable of; just a very little distortion is hardly noticeable). I use them at a moderated volume and I love its sound quality. I really like their bass sound also, it is incredibly good considering the compact size.<br /><br />I also love how they look, even when they are closed and organized because they have a magnet on the bottom that keeps them together and aligned, making the operation of slipping them inside their bag something pretty simple to do. Btw regarding to those magnets, there is a serious warning in the documentation they're provided with, and refers not to place these speakers near screens or pc towers because magnets can affect them hopelessly. The warning scares! (just imagine consequences!), so be careful with that thing.<br /><br />I use them with my smartphone and have found them to be the perfect solution.

Motorola Signal Booster 4-Port Cable Modem TV HDTV Amplifier with Active Return Cable Modem Boost,Electronics,5,"For the past year I was having all sorts of issues with my Optimum Online (Cablevision NY/NJ area) cable internet just dropping its signal and my modem would reset all day long at times for hour long periods at a time! I had a bad line coming into the house so I recently went around looking for solutions to this and came across these Motorola products. I'll go over what levels I had before the installation as I had written them down.<br /><br />I had a Signal to Noise Ratio of 32dB, Downstream Power Level at -16dBmV, and an Upstream Power Level at 54dBmV. After installing the Motorola K4 I noticed a huge difference in my signal quality both for channels that used to freeze up on the cablebox and my internet. Please don't think that this will improve your overall internet speed, that is a common misconception. What this product did was strengthen the signal coming into my house, that is where I had this Motorola hooked up, in my basement 1 line coming in 4 lines going out to all the different rooms in the house.<br /><br />Here was the huge difference in levels I got after this installation. Signal to Noise Ratio went up slightly to 34dB, Downstream Power Level became +16 (from -16), and the Upstream Power Level the one where you'll notice the most problems went down to 38dBmV which is excellent signal quality. This was when I first hooked it up, I checked the levels the next couple of days just to make sure everything was fine and the Upstream Power Level would fluctuate between 38dBmV - 45 dBmV, much better than the 54dBmV I had before. I definitely recommend this to people who are having severe issues as I was having, Good luck.",0.9719,positive

Sentey® Universal Earbuds Carrying Case Ls-7521,Electronics,4,"This case has a nice hard oval case.  I like the choice of colors and matte finish.  It has one wrap-around zipper.  It only has one netted pocket, which is guess is because the case is a bit on the small side.  It is perfect for simple, lightweight, generic ear buds--like what you get the box with your Apple products.  If your cord is very pliable and thin and if the in-ear pieces are not elaborate, then this is a good choice.  You can wind a thin cord around your two fingers and plop it on in this case and close it up.  No trouble, no hassle, and easy-peasy.<br /><br />On the other hand.....To give you a better perspective of the size of this case; just so you can determine if this case is large enough for your use:  See the bottom picture on this product page?  I'm telling you that it took a while for them to get that larger pair of in-ear, ear phones, with a flat wire, wound around like that and sitting pretty in the case.  That set-up is close to the several in-ear head phones that I have.  I also have a few pair over-the-ear, and a pair with some pretty stiff wires.  So I know:  This case is a tight fit.  If it is a tight fit, it takes attention and time to get it wound right so that you don't crimp a wire when you go to close the lid.  Each time I use this case I have to try and try again, because I have wires and ends popping out of the case before I can get it zippered shut.<br /><br />The measurements listed in Product Details, Dimensions, are correct.  I suggest you take close consideration of the height of this case:  1.3 inches.  The cases I use now are 1 3/4&#34; tall, and that extra half inch makes all the difference.  Maybe I'm spoiled.  These are less expensive, so if budget is an issue and if you want to protect your smaller, basic ear buds, this case is perfect for you.<br /><br />*I received a sample product from Sentey.",0.9883,positive

AmazonBasics Ultra Thin Indoor HDTV Antenna,Electronics,4,"To summarize a long review: This is the antenna I ended up keeping.  It doesn’t work perfectly, but because I can easily mount it in the best spot, it works the best out of the antennas I tried.<br /><br />Comcast charging me a fee to rent a box just to get limited basic was the last straw.  I finally decided to switch to an antenna to get mostly the same channels.  I live less than five miles from the towers for all the major stations in the area, so I expected good results.  This was not the case, and I ended up trying three antennas, and all were disappointing.<br /><br />Since I was so close to the towers, I bought the cheap RCA ANT111F first.  It picked up the local stations, but it would regularly cut out.  If anyone walked around the room, if there was a storm and sometimes just randomly, it would cut out.<br /><br />So I tried the slightly more expensive RCA ANT1251F, which has some sort of amplifier.  It seemed to be slightly better, but still regularly cut out.  It was still bad enough where you couldn’t watch a show because you would miss half of it.  There appeared to be no difference with the amplifier on or off.<br /><br />So I thought I would try one of these flat style Antennas.  There are a lot of them on amazon, but I picked this one because it was cheaper than the Mohu Leaf and it appeared to be a rebranded Winegard.  I put it in the same place as the other antennas, and surprise, it was just as bad as them.  The VHF performance was actually worse, probably due to the lack of large rabbit ears.  As with the previous antenna, there also appeared to be no difference with the amplifier on or off.  One good thing though, is that you can plug it into a USB port on your TV so that it shuts off when you turn off your TV.<br /><br />At this point I was very frustrated.  I can see the towers from my house, but I can’t reliably pick up the stations?  I decided to try the antenna in different places, something that wasn’t really feasible with the other antennas.  Eventually I found a decent spot that was around a corner and up by the ceiling.  In this spot it occasionally picks up a station that is 45 miles away, which none of the other antennas could do.  It still cuts out occasionally on some local stations, but it works the best out of all of the antennas I tried.",0.0172,neutral

Omnimount Elements 403FP 3-Shelf Flat-Panel Floor Stand for Most 32-Inch to 47-Inch Flat Panels (Black) (Discontinued by Manufacturer),Electronics,5,"I bought this stand for a 47 inch Vizio, and a medium-small living room about a month ago. I also have a PS3, Xbox 360, large audio receiver, two small speakers, a large center speaker, an internet modem, and a router....all on the stand. It looks fantastic. The changeable colored plates are a great touch for Omnimount that I haven't encountered before. I chose the Cherry, but all of them seem to be of high quality and all of them look very nice.<br /><br />Construction look myself and a friend about an hour from opening the box to mounting the TV, and you will want help for some of the steps. I'm sure it is possible to manage alone, but an extra set of hands seemed required at several stages. I believe all necessary tools were included, though I used a few of my own. No power tools required.<br /><br />There are several things I was impressed with about this stand. First, the quality of the parts is outstanding. I have assembled many furniture kits in the past and a common issue is holes not lining up and cheap parts not fitting or working properly. Not an issue with this set. All components were well labeled and all parts were numbered and organized. The instructions are only pictures, but they are the true meaning of step-by-step and are again, well organized. They won't add so many parts in a single step and do not leave you confused and missing things. Another thing I was concerned with was compatibility. However, they truly earned their Omnimount name with this kit. There are all different sizes of mount screws to suit probably any common type of TV and brand. A little bit of trail-and-error allowed me to find the correct screws and it was a breeze mounting the TV (find a helper!). You are left with a bunch of extra parts, but they make sure that you don't build the whole thing only to find out that your TV doesn't want to mount.<br /><br />This review is starting to get long, but I also wanted to mention the capability of this stand to suit any need. I love the way it looks when the TV is actually on the swivel mount. However, they provide clear instructions if you choose to use the TV's stand and place it on the glass, the instructions let you know when to stop building it. Also, if you choose to mount it above the stand on the wall, they also provide the hardware and instruction to do that as well. Everything about the stand feels like quality, and I am happy to have it as the focal point of my living room and it makes a great addition to my entertainment system. I would purchase from Omnimount again.",0.9962,positive

Smart Strip LCG5 Energy Saving Power Strip with Auto-Switching Technology and Modem/Coaxial Surge Protection,Electronics,5,"I bought two of these power strips back in Feb 2011 and I already have seen a drop in my kilowatt consumption and electric bill in comparison to last year and previous months.

Like many homeowners I have a computer area with printer, hardrives, speakers,camera chargers, phone chargers, bluetooth audio trasmitters and an entertainment center with large screen TV, two game consoles, audio receiver, CD Player, modem, router, DVR etc. I did not realize how much all these devices were costing me until I bought the two strips. It came in one shipment and I had to return one of them because it was not working right even after adjusting for sensitivity. Amazon sent another one in no time and both have been working fine since. What is nice about this model is that it has several jacks giving you flexibility in regards to the number of devices that can remain on or turn off automatically.I find the purchase price very reasonable considering that it is also a surge protector, is saving me a couple bucks a month and I feel less guilty about harming the environment.

Tuff-Luv Leather case cover for (Nokia E75) - Black,Electronics,1,"What you don't see clearly in the pictures of this product, is that a transparent plastic holds the phone in place (covering half the face of the phone).

Mine tore on the first insertion, though the plastic part of the pouch hasn't burst yet, and overall, still does the trick (This is day 2 of possession of the pouch), I don't think forty plus dollars is a good price for a pouch of this design.    It's also difficult to slide out the face of the Nokia e75 to get to the Qwerty board, because, of course, the transparent plastic holds on tightly to the phone.

I decided to keep it for myself. It's pretty loud. I can compare the sound to being louder than the JBL Charge with way better bass. I was surprised at how much bass it really kicked out. The lights really give it an elegant look and there's an on and off switch on the back, one for lights and one for power. Everyone that hears and sees it wants one. I love the Bluetooth feature and that you can place your phone or tablet on it. FM presets would have made this perfect but that is the only thing I could think of. I will be ordering more as I owe someone a gift😁",0.9935,positive

It's loud, gives enough bass, and is quite large (look at the specs).  Overall it's a 7.5 out of 10.  Good buy for the casual surround sound setup.",0.8516,positive

Black DisplayPort Male to VGA Female Adapter,Electronics,3,"I bought this adapter a couple of years ago, and it mostly worked great. It's Plug and Play with no software to bother with.<br /><br />But, the unit is a little bulky. On my work PC (HP 6005), the DVI port is RIGHT next to the VGA output. I needed to jam it in a bit for it to fit and operate. Today, the adapter had enough, and practically exploded! The black case (which is just snapped on) fell off and  connecting wires came out of the DVI connector. I don't know if it would have &#34;exploded&#34; under normal use, but the unit does seem to be cheaply constructed.",0.6696,positive

Sony Childrens Headphones,Electronics,5,"Bought 2 pairs of these for my 5 year old kids.  The says they are for 8 years and above.  Not sure if that is a liability thing or what, but my 5 year olds have no problem wearing them.  I tried them on myself and attached them to my iPod and was surprised at how good they sound.  Not sure how the volume lowering works but at full volume on my iPod they did seem a little quieter than my ear-buds so I guess it works.  As for construction.  They are all plastic and seem like they make break if given some rough treatment although that is not my experience!  They are holding up very well to the abuse of young kids who use them all the time with their Leapsters and tote them around everywhere they go.  4 starts for ease of use because my daughter seems to have a little trouble keeping them on sometimes (hmm, maybe if she was 8 they would fit better).",0.8843,positive

What impressed me most about this product is that it does not &#34;fatten up&#34; when full--even stuffed with DVDs, this case is no thicker than when I bought it.<br /><br />Also, if you're worried about flimsy interior pockets, fear no more! The individual sleeves are well-constructed, so I haven't had to deal with any tears even after obsessively removing and re-inserting DVDs in alphabetical order. I am very glad that I bought these.",-0.8439,negative
SanDisk Sansa m250 2 GB MP3 Player,Electronics,5,"Prior to selecting this unit, i'd looked at the Creative Zen Stone, Ipod shuffle, and the Sansa Clip. Those looked pretty good EXCEPT they used lame rechargeable batteries. Hey i don't mind carrying batteries around, and when my player is low on energy i want to be able to put in a new one and be set to go. Not have to shackle it to my PC's USB port to charge for 2-3 hours. To make matters worse some of those models mentioned above have no way to remove/replace the rechargeable, so when the battery dies your left with a dead unit.     So those were out. Only other decent 1GB+ MP3 options i could find on amazon that used regular batteries, were the Coby-C885 and this Sansa M250 that i'm reviewing now. The coby was nice but its weakpoint was its lousy signal output not being loud enough.     Finally tried this unit and it hit the mark! It uses regular AA batteries and no rechargeable junk, AND the signal output quality is quite loud. About 12% louder than the coby. Nice!    Other than that the unit is easy to use, has a nice amount of standard MP3 features, compact, and looks slick. Playing music & progressing from track to track is a breeze, the LCD display is nicely lit, and loading music onto it was simple and fast. It comes with pre-set sound equalizers like \\""Jazz\\"" and \\""Rock\\"", but what i really like is it has a CUSTOM equalizer setting, where you can tweak the sound to your own preferences.    Overall: using regular batteries for power, nice standard features, neat design, and ease of use, all makes this player a winner and recommended. Also an unexpected surprise: The earbud headphones included with this player, they were actually BETTER than my own set and got replaced with them. This was money well spent.",0.9928,positive

My friend's model requires AC power to operate; I purchased the model with the built-in rechargeable battery. I'm very pleased with the battery life (over 5 hours at any volume) and the sound quality. The only negative is you must have the remote to change the volume. Not a fan of that design concept.    Prior to this I owned a LogiTech unit whose rechargeable battery completely died after less than a year, and even when it was working battery life was a couple hours at best. The Bose unit is twice the price but more than twice the capability.",0.7819,positive

Black Sonoma 5 Drawer Chest,Furniture,4,"The unit assembled with no hitches but took longer than the instruction guidance indicated. I've put together quite a few cam-lock pieces including a very complicated office desk set and have a speed screw driver that really speeds up assembly. For example, they indicate that each drawer should take 5 minutes to assemble but it took me about 35 or 40 minutes to assemble all 5 drawers or about 7 1/2 minutes per drawer with no difficulties of any kind. Bottom line, I would figure 4 hours total time to open everything, lay it out, make sure all the parts are there, assemble the unit and clean up.<br /><br />The assembled unit looks exactly as it does in the picture. It looks good, the finish is nice and the drawers work well. My only criticism is that it's not very sturdy...that is, it's susceptible to shear. In order to stiffen it up I'm going to attach a brace diagonally across the back which should work just fine.",0.9627,positive

So incredibly frustrating!  Since I owned them, I have had to vacuum those stupid beans up everyday.  You get what you pay for!  The quality is just not there.

Swopper Special Edition Motion Chair - Distributed by Via,Furniture,5,"Been sitting on a ball for a few years when I worked from home. It really tightened up my core muscles and back trouble became a rare event. Got an office job and after a couple of months in a regular chair the old back problems were starting up. A ball would be tricky to deal with at work so I picked up a used Swopper off of Craigslist. The movement is similar to a ball, with better stability. I'm really enjoying it and my back is happy again. The seat is firmer than a ball and my tail bone was sore for the first few days, but I position differently now and do not have the problem any more.<br /><br />I don't sit on it like an office chair with knees and hips at right angles with legs together. I sit higher with knees apart, and move my legs to different positions, rocking and bouncing throughout the day. The idea is to stay active and not spend hours in the same position, stressing the same points and cutting down your circulation. I feel much fresher at the end of the day now.",0.7638,positive

I chose it because I believed it would be more effective than some of the less expensive non slip rug pads, but it is not.

Classic Brands 8-Inch Advantage Innerspring Mattress,Furniture,5,"When first receiving the box, I had no idea what it was.  I expected a long box and for it to be rough around the edges.  What you get is a mattress freakishly rolled into a duffle bag.  When removing it, you know right off the bat that you will never be able to put it back into that bag.  So the bag really serves no purpose for the bedding, but could be used for something like an artificial christmas tree maybe, or a bag for storing basketballs and over sports equipment.  I say all this as there is no way you are getting the mattress back into the bag.  I would imagine if it were simple wrapped in plastic it would cost less to ship and a lower price.<br /><br />Regardless, the mattress itself is actually impressive at this price point.  You might be able to get a memory foam mattress topper at the price point, but never expect an invididually coil spring bed.  They ask to let the bed stay out for a day or so for it to fully expand, but it didn't take long.  It is actuall quite comfortable and conforms well with your body.  I would consider this more of a guest bed than an everyday use replacement.  But it's not like an air mattress that you can put away after each use.  So wherever you put it is where it stays.<br /><br />Though I orefe a King size, I did sleep on it a couple nights over the past month and woke up well rested.  Perfect for a day or bunk bed, sleepovers, visitors etc.  Don't be afraid of the low price.  The quality for what you are paying for is exceptional.",0.94,positive

My only complaint is that some of the wood, especially on the corners of the file drawer, were damaged.  Also, one of the boards to be screwed onto the keyboard drawer was broken.  This occurred because there was a large knot in the wood and it was too fragile to make it through shipping unscathed.  I glued the broken pieces of wood together using some wood glue and a vice and, once secure enough, I screwed it onto the keyboard shelf. The damage to the corners and the repaired wood piece ended up behind closed doors, so I did not want to have to go through the hassle of shipping the entire unit back for these purposes.

Came with a sticker sheet to label pieces, but pieces weren't clearly labeled in the instruction Manuel, so they were pointless. Ended up having to follow the equally difficult to read pictures. Totally screwed up one of the drawers on the second one; It is entirely possible this was due to &#34;user error&#34;, however, I feel like some of the product (screws, openings, etc.) were just plain defective.<br /><br />That being said, they were a great color, perhaps slightly darker than pictured but not enough to moan about.

Powell Woodbury Mahogany Coat Rack,Furniture,1,"This would be a beautiful coat rack.  The wood is gorgeous and the detail is special.  But it arrived with the main piece having a crack the full length.  We are awaiting the replacement part, with the rest sitting in the corner.  It was a huge disappointment, but they claim one was sent right away, I first had to photograph it and send it to them.  I have had less hassle from other suppliers who sent replacement, no question, and several times, the whole thing, not just the piece that is broken.  I have to buy on line as I live where there is not a lot of selection, so I am getting good at knowing what to accept and what not to.  I am a little iffy about this because the crack came from the factory not bad shipping, which meant somewhere the quality control is not good.  I have hope, so I rated it ok.<br /><br />I'm updating my review. It's been 10 days since I sent the photo of the damaged piece and I have not received one piece of information about it since.  I guess the next step is contacting Amazon and requesting a refund.  It was so pretty, it's sad they have such poor quality control and customer service.

Amazon customer service was excellent in their response to this problem - they offered to have them shipped back or offered an adjustment to the price.

Southern Enterprises Black Metal End Table,Furniture,3,"I received this table and started assembling it, only to find that one of its legs was broken.

When I called to see where the replacement was, they told me that I had to call UPS to correct the address (even though they had made the error).  I went to the trouble of calling UPS, only to find out that the sending company (not the recipient) is authorized to change the address on a package.  I am very disappointed with this company.  I ordered this product a few weeks ago, and to date I still have not been able to use it.    I have ordered other tables from SEI, and they were fine - no broken parts.

Spirit Sleep Serenity Theratouch 10-Inch Memory Foam Mattress,Furniture,5,"I purchased the mattress 11 months ago now.  I'm very happy with the purchase.    As people usually note..  -  Foam mattresses do smell for a few days but it wasn't particularly bad.  You probably don't want to let it air out for a full day and night before you sleep on it.  -  Foam mattresses are warmer than regular mattresses.  I don't mind, though my wife comments on it being warm.  Using a non-foam mattress cover/pad helps if it's a concern because you get a layer that breathes between you and the mattress.  -  It doesn't transfer motion.  I'm a night person and often go to bed later than my wife so it's a nice feature.  We've got ours on our old box spring so that does creak but it supports the mattress well.    Now on to the good stuff.  I've had chronic back pain for almost 20 years now.   The first greatest thing I ever did for my back was to to splurge on a pair of real MBT shoes 2 or 3 years back [best shoes I've ever owned.. still wearing them].  The second was to buy this mattress last year.  After getting this mattress, my back pain is almost entirely gone.  Very rarely do I feel any discomefort anymore and I've been totally slacking on my core exercises for probably 6 months now.  I should be a wreck but I'm not.  I'm writing this in March and I wear my MBTs much less frequently in the winter because the foam soles soak up water.  I should really be suffering right now but the mattress is still saving me from the back pain I've endured for decades.    I also hurt my shoulders a couple years back while doing push-ups and they would never fully heal.  It didn't help when I'd limit use, and it didn't help when I exercised them to strengthen up the joint.   After purchasing the mattress, that pain is completely under control.  It'll flare up from time to time to what I'd call an ache.. but I don't have the persistent burning pain I'd get before that.    If you've got joint pain, particularly in your back or in areas that compress when you're sleeping (shoulders.. hips..) you're crazy to not get a memory foam mattress.  It's really changed my life.  No kidding.    I spent a lot of time comparing models before buying this mattress and I was a bit nervous about the reasonable price point.  I'd have gone for a more expensive name brand but we had just bought a house so funds were tight (the mattress was actually waiting for us at the new house when we arrived with our moving truck :-)  I have absolutely no regrets with the purchase though.  I can't imagine how the $1500 mattresses can justify their price when you can get the Spirit Sleep this cheap.",-0.7472,negative

The side pockets at the top do not span the width of the bars they are covering, which is unfortunate. My son still likes it because he can put all sorts of things in the pockets and the velcro seems to hold. It does add to the overall appeal of the bed and I would buy it again, but I would probably select a different style, such as the fire department curtains.<br /><br />I agree with the other reviewers, it came with no instructions or pictures.",-0.1531,negative

Wall MURAL Vinyl Sticker Car DODGE CHALLENGER COOL 013,Furniture,3,"Be careful when ordering this vinyl decal. Its large but not so large that it needed to have the leading edge cut off in the photograph. The picture here and on the website, stickalz.com shows the front of the car cut off by the left hand side of the image boundry. Had they centered the decal in the photograph you would see that the decal is actually missing the front of the car. I unrolled the decal and thought I had received the last decal cut from a roll of vinyl. I own an SRT so I don't want a decal of an R/T and this is the only SRT decal they offer. I'll get creative but I'd rather have the full car. All the other decals of the Dodge Challenger are complete cars. The way this decal has been photographed, with the leading edge of the decal flush against the edge of the picture, looks to be intentionally deceptive. Three stars due to quick shipping, affordable, and it is exactly as it appears in the photo. Minus two for deceptive photo and being exactly as shown in the photo.",-0.0717,negative
"Simple Practical Inexpensive Tall Nightstand Lingerie Lamp Table - 37"" Woven Fiber Rattan Style Chest of 4 or 5 Drawers in 5 Beautiful Colors",Furniture,2,"I read all the reviews and thought, well how bad can it be?  To be honest I have done a ton of research to find something like this for my bathroom. I wanted to replace my current metal with plastic drawers with something bigger and nicer.  And there's NOTHING that I could find.  The drawers get stuck especially with heavier stuff like a hairdryer are in it!  So I only put stuff in it that I don't need daily because it annoys me so much. I was going to send it back but tossed the ton of packaging it came with.  End result - I'm still using my metal/plastic drawer for make-up, brushes, blow dryer (everyday stuff) and left my travel toiletries, extra soup, shampoos and things I tend to forget about in this!<br /><br />A few other notes:<br />-it is shaky and unstable.<br />-it is not prefect - white paint is likely sprayed on so it misses the little cracks<br />-the drawers stick - good thing it keeps my toddler out of it because he can't open it so he completely lost interest in it (good thing-yeah?)",0.8025,positive

Phifertex Plus Mesh Replacement Cover Set for Directors Chair ROUND STICK,Furniture,5,"Perhaps I'm stingy, but the cost of outdoor furniture bothers me (unless we're talking those ubiquitous white plastic chairs, which bother me for other reasons--hideousness, anyone?). So, I tend to buy furniture at yard sales where, naturally, those less stingy sell their pricey furniture as soon as the seats and backs wear out. Score! But, this leaves me with the necessity of finding replacement seats and backs. I spent some serious worrying time on the dimensions of these seat covers since I didn't have the originals to measure, but in the end they fit my $5-for-two frames perfectly. The construction is solid, and although they've only been on the frames for a couple of weeks, they're holding up like champs. I would definitely recommend these replacement covers to any frugal (cough-stingy-cough) people out there like me.",0.9504,positive

They're not bad and luckily one is covered by my keyboard and the other by my monitor but for those scratches I will have to take 1 star.<br />Setting it up was fairly simple and takes around an hour to an hour and a half. I really recommend having one or two more people helping you out, it will save you so much time and it will make things easier to put together.<br />Other than the scratches I am 100% happy with the purchase and it really is worth the money.<br />I have my computer case around 50+ lbs and a 40 inch monitor (20lbs) and it still feels very sturdy. Feels like it can support more weight as well which is what I was really worried about.<br />School is starting up again and I needed a desk with more space which is why I went with the &#34;L-Shape&#34; one side for my computer and one side as a desk for school work.<br />Overall, for around $90 this desk is really worth it!

Flash Furniture Mid-Back Black Mesh Office Chair with Chrome Finished Base,Furniture,1,"so after months of using it, it began to squeak.  the noise was very annoying.  I had an extra pneumatic cylinder and decided to replace it.  couldn't get the cylinder out of the base of the seat or the chair base.  went to a few garages thinking they could help me and no luck there.  I emailed the company and they sent me video links to show me how to replace it.  wasn't even the same style of cylinder.  finally, in total frustration, I threw the whole thing in the garbage.  couldn't fix it or use it, didn't have room for the parts and pieces to just sit there.  NEVER AGAIN!<br /><br />I didn't think I liked the seat at first, but after using the chair for a few weeks now I've decided I do like it.  I love the fact that it offers quite a height range.  I contacted the manufacturer when I thought I was having problems with the hydraulic lift and within 10 days they sent me a replacement hydraulic cylinder.  Now I call that fantastic customer service.  their questions were to ascertain exactly what the problem was.  never made me feel bad about the problem.  Amazon's price was fantastic.

Lucas Leather Recliner Club Chair,Furniture,4,"Really quick service, easy to put together and looks nice. I bought two of these recliners to go in the large master bedroom where we have a flat screen set up for watching movies in the evenings. We are both average size people (5'4&#34; and 5'10&#34;) and the chairs are very comfortable at least for a two hour movie. No naps taken in these chairs but I think it would be doable. We both have lower back issues so we use a small pillow for a little extra support but we do that with most of our other furniture too. The one thing that I do not like is on the backside of the chairs, the material is not taut so it looks a bit wrinkled. This isn't a BIG issue for me but it's just more noticeable because the backsides are visible the way we have them arranged. If they were with their backsides closer to the wall where you didn't walk behind them, it would be a total non-issue. These chairs aren't big over stuffed recliners but they are a decent size and fit nicely in the area of the bedroom.",0.8572,positive

Not only did the unit fit my needs for the craft shows it was nicely built and sturdy. After the craft shows I could not seem to place the unit in storage with the rest of my craft show items.  I liked it so much that it now sits in my living room as extra storage.  <br /> <br />There is no hesitatation on my part in recommending the Mission Style folding bookcase to anyone.

I knew it would be made entirely of the cheapest available plastic, particle board, and veneer. In that respect, this product absolutely met my expectations. I also expect, however, that all the components will be free from damage or defect. On that regard, this product fails.<br /><br />One of the three shelves arrived cracked on one corner. Given that there was no damage to the packaging and the fact the other two shelves, stacked neatly together with the cracked shelf, were damage-free, I can only conclude that the shelf was placed into the packaging already cracked.

"TMS 5 Piece Hamilton Dining Set , Espresso",Furniture,3,"I really like the look of this dining set, but the quality isn't the greatest. When it first arrived at my location it had to small chips on the table itself, very noticeable and they didn't provide a marker or paint in the box to cover it up. I managed to keep that side facing the wall so people won't notice, but they're still there. Other that, the table is good, made of solid wood. However, it is pretty small, roughly about the size of a desk. As for the chairs, they are decent, but the screws holding them together require tightening every once in a while. I would recommend using wood glue to keep them from coming loose. On a side note, these are not really meant for heavier people. They're fine for my boyfriend and myself, but some of our slightly larger friends managed to make them get extremely loose just by sitting on them. I would say they can hold up to 175 lbs without a problem. The set serves its function okay, but eventually I will have to replace this. Most likely I'll keep the table for a desk and maybe one chair, but the rest will have to go. I would only recommend it to those who are on a budget and don't have many guests over.",0.9352,positive

It just says that it may take 24-48 for the foam to completely expand/take shape. Ours was almost fully expanded within 10 minutes.<br /><br />The mattress is great! We've both slept well on it. It is &#34;firm&#34; meaning you don't sink into it like you would on a pillow top coil mattress. It doesn't have that feeling, however, as the foam warms and molds to your body, the pressure us relieved and still get that exquisite comfort feeling.<br /><br />As far as the smell, it smells like new foam. Not strong chemical, etc. It didn't bother either of us, but everyone's senses are different.<br /><br />It took me a while to commit to buying a mattress online, but I'm very happy that I did. It was a great decision, a great price and it was delivered to my door.<br /><br />If you're considering it, I'd say it would be a great decision.",0.9894,positive

I fortified myself by acquiring two screwdrivers: one of the Phillips variety, another with a flat motif. Still, I knew that the most necessary tool would have to come from somewhere deep inside.

"King's Brand Furniture B125H Wood Arched Design Convertible Bunk Bed, Twin, Honey Finish",Furniture,4,"We set up only the top bunk to us as a bed for our 2.5-year-old. It arrived in good shape, the instructions were not the most detailed ever but I found them easy enough to follow, and the bed looks nice and seems sturdy.<br /><br />Our one issue is with the size--we're using an Ikea mattress that I believe is a standard twin size, but the frame is slightly too big--there's about three extra inches of length and 1-2 extra inches of width.  Looking up standard mattress sizes online, the answer seems to be that twin is 75&#34;x39&#34;, and the bed dimensions are listed as 82x42.  So subtracting a couple inches from the length and 1.5&#34; or so from the width to account for the frame, that seems to match what I'm seeing.  But I don't understand why they would build it that way.<br /><br />Also, I guess our mattress is thicker than the ones in the picture, because it comes up to around the bottom of the top rail (rather than the top of the bottom rail).  I think the rail is still high enough above the mattress to keep the kid from falling out, but I'd be happier if it were a little taller.<br /><br />But still, it has been serving well for the few weeks we've had it, and for the price, I'm satisfied.",0.9731,positive

It does take time to expand, but there is no smell and it is true to size. The mattress is on the firm side, but it is comfortable even for those who prefer something a little softer- the foam has just the right amount of give to make everyone happy. It also stays cool, so you won't sweat on warm nights.<br /><br />It doesn't fold well, so it really is a mattress and not a cushion for a futon you want to use as a couch, so keep that in mind.

Flash Furniture High Back Black Leather Executive Office Chair with Leather Padded Loop Arms,Furniture,5,"Regarding Gas Cylinder Misconceptions:<br />After reading the reviews regarding the pneumatic cylinder (\\""gas lift\\""), I was skeptical of purchasing this chair. However; I did anyway due to the facts that 1.) I knew I could replace the cylinder if it failed and 2.) Wal-Mart accepts returns on this chair with no receipt due to it being sold on their website (this costs Wal-Mart no money, as they are reimbursed by the manufacturer).<br />After unpacking the chair, I noticed that the pneumatic cylinder was EXTREMELY well-constructed. Either they have gone with a new manufacturer for their cylinders, or the previous negative reviews were due to a faulty batch or customer abuse. I also read a review stating that once the cylinder is attached, it can not be replaced. This is absolutely incorrect. If the cylinder were to fail, you can purchase a generic replacement for $5-10 and have it changed out in mere minutes. Anyone is able to do this.<br /><br />THAT SAID, I absolutely love this chair. I suffer from 2 herniated desks, and being a self-employed Internet Marketer / Entrepreneur, I spend anywhere from 12-18, sometimes 20 hours per day in an office chair. This is the first chair that has not hurt my back... I suffer from almost constant pain, but when sitting in this chair, my pain completely disappears the majority of the time which is AMAZING considering that my pain is pretty much continuous. The lumbar support design is wonderful, contouring to my back perfectly, and even that of different height friends.<br /><br />PADDING / COMFORT:<br />The padding is excellent; not too firm, not too soft... You can tell that a lot of attention and detail was put into the construction of this chair. It is VERY sturdy; no wobbles, no weak parts which I could foresee breaking, and completely different feeling than the in-store \\""Executive Chairs\\"" which Wal-Mart, etc. stock for the same (or higher) price. Even as a large guy, when reclining completely in this chair, there is no strain on the support members of the chair back.<br /><br />LUMBAR SUPPORT / GENERAL FITMENT:<br />I am 6'2\\"" 250lbs (experience from shorter person below); not a small guy by any means. This chair fits me perfectly and the lumbar support rests directly against my lower back (and oh gosh is it comfortable), and gives me great posture. This is the most comfortable char I have ever sat in... and not just as far as office chairs.<br />My girlfriend, who is 5'7\\"" loves the chair also, finding it just as comfortable as I do. The lumbar support also hits her back in the proper spot... From this, I'm going to go ahead and assume that this is a perfect chair for any size.<br /><br />Chair back locked up, or reclined, both are extremely comfortable. The straight up lock is not \\""too straight\\"" like some other chairs.<br /><br />Ergonomic chairs allow more adjustment, but this chair is built to not need it... Read online how an ergonomic chair should be configured to be optimal. I did all the \\""tests\\"", and this chair is already configured perfectly for myself (and seems to be for people smaller and slightly bigger than myself also).<br /><br />MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS:<br />The caster wheels are of sufficient quality, and seem to be very low-friction... They roll very easily on carpet, wood, or tile. My office is ceramic tile, and the wheels DO roll a slight bit too easily, but it is not difficult to adjust to.<br />The arm and wheelbase supports are Nylon Plastic... NOT METAL. I bought the chair with the mindset that I ONLY wanted metal supports (both arm and wheelbase), due to the arm supports being the main failure point.<br />HOWEVER; The arm / wheelbase supports are EXTREMELY THICK and high-quality... They have NO give whatsoever, and I can guarantee they will not fail. The arm supports are literally 3.5-4 inches thick, and are not the low-quality polymer of other chairs. These are high strength nylon.<br /><br />FINAL CONSENSUS:<br /><br />This chair is absolutely amazing. I wasgoing to say \\""amazing for the price\\"" but that would be far downplaying how great this chair is.<br /><br />I have sat in (and was looking to buy) chairs in the $400-600 range that were less comfortable and less durable than this chair.<br />I have NEVER found a chair with this good of a contour or lumbar support.<br />I have sat in this chair for a maximum of 10 hours straight so far with no agitation of my 2 herniated discs (1 Thoracic, 1 Lumbar). No chair (office chair or otherwise) has ever been that \\""kind\\"" to my back.<br /><br />Bottom line; I would feel comfortable paying upwards of $500 for this chair and still be satisfied. For the professional who spends the majority of their day in their office chair, or for the casual user who may only spend 15 minutes at a time in it; this chair is too darn good to pass up.(and was looking to buy) chairs in the $400-600 range that were less comfortable and less durable than this chair.

The seat adjusts fore and aft relative to the base, the whole seat has an angle adjustment with a separate setting for the back, the arms adjust in and out and up and down, or can be removed. Took me 5 minutes to get the right height and still have my feet flat, with lumbar and back support, withe arms well positioned.

"Homelegance 1193F1S Flared Arm Accent Chair, Khaki Brown",Furniture,4,"Chairs arrived within about 2 weeks and they were packed well. They are very pretty! I love the design, colors and all! Fabric is a beige-cream, like a hazelnut coffee cream color and the French script is a taupe-gray or some call it smoke gray...perfect to match with my curtains. I'm disappointed that the legs do not sit flush against the frame (the cut out of the wood on the legs) once the chairs are assembled, but you don't notice it unless you get down eye level with the bottom of the chair. To fix that, you have to trim off about 1/4 to 3/8 inch of the part of the leg that goes up into the frame and then the screw holes may not match up. Besides that...the black fabric on the bottom of the chairs is velcroed to cover up the ugly. Well, it tears extremely easy like tissue paper. I have to make another one to fix that. The cushion is firm, but I know it will soften with use. The fabric, is beautiful but you can tell that it is thin, so I don't know how many years it will hold up with regular use. I would not pay more than the $259.00, because they are produced by the dozen so the workmanship has its flaws. Just remember, you get what you pay for. For me, the colors were as shown. So make sure your monitor hasn't been messed with.<br />Besides all that, I wanted this review to be as informative as possible.

Once full put-together, they look real nice and should hold up for a long time.<br /><br />It should be noted - and this is the one star off - the seat is NOT leather.

"Sauder Edge Water Panel TV Stand, Estate Black Finish",Furniture,3,"I bought this TV cabinet because I thought the design was good, especially it had drawers at the top where I could conveniently access.  But the problem starts immediately after I opened the package.<br /><br />First, the boards and the parts are not packed in a way that you could start assembling after taking out some boards.  You have to take out almost all the boards and the parts before you can start putting things together.  That takes a lot of space just to put down all the boards.  So be prepared to leave adequate floor space before starting your assembly process.<br /><br />Second, dozens of the different small mounting parts are all contained in one plastic bag.  So you have to search for parts in that single bag while you are putting the boards together.  That way of packaging must have saved the manufacturer a lot of time but you have to waste a lot of time just for looking for parts.<br /><br />Third, all the boards, except the back board, which is a thin cardboard, are made from brittle particle boards.  The only real wood parts that come from the package are the two 1.5\\"" by 1.5\\"" by 2\\"" studs used as the leg supports.  Because the boards are brittle, there was an edge damage that was found after assembling.  It was caused by the the sidebar that was installed at the side of the top board.  No excessive screwing was used but the edge was still damaged.  I didn't wanna take trouble to repackage the cabinet and return it back, so I decided to live with it.  It's a shame.",-0.6306,negative
Sleep Innovations Shiloh Memory Foam Mattress,Furniture,5,"We love this mattress! Got a king size, put on our own box springs on the floor for now.

As soon as you cut the bag open it starts to fluff up quick. We slept on it after about 3 hours with no problems. It did smell a *little* chemical-ly the first few seconds we opened it, but it went away very quickly. I do feel a little like I roll to the edge of it at night like the middle is higher than the edges, but my husband doesn't notice it so it may just be me. I no longer have little aches and pains when I wake up in the morning. I'm a side sleeper with my arm under my pillow, and in my old mattress, I would always wake up with my arm asleep.

Absinthe Blanqui Thermometer Tin Sign 2 x 11in,Furniture,2,"Thermometer has beautiful graphics and the enamel paint seems like it will last, even as an outdoor piece.<br />The thermometer itself is held with two small metal clamps (appear to be stainless steel) and the base sits within a metal housing with a &#34;window&#34; for the bubble. This really adds to the overall look of the piece. Other then being small (2&#34; X 11&#34;) I would rate it 4 stars on its appearance.<br />The backing is made of the thinnest tin you will see in your life. It is so thin it feels like you are holding a piece of tin foil. Really hard to believe how thin and cheap it is made. (too bad it wasn’t surrounded by a stainless steel boarder, that would really have made it look amazing)  Also, my thermometer was off by 8 degrees. I have a good digital thermometer and a real mercury meter. Both show the same temperature, 8 degrees higher then this one reads. The good news is the thermometer can be slid up / down to depict the true temperature. The bad news is mine was so far off it placed the &#34;mercury&#34; bubble (they do not use real mercury in thermometers these days) behind the metal that is supposed to show through its window.

Flash Furniture High Back Executive Office Chair 46.25-50H in. - Black,Furniture,4,"I partially disagree with the other two reviews. I ordered two of these, each chair has 12 screws. Out of the 24 total screws i had trouble with one screw but i eventually got it. The chairs do not require two people to assemble. I admit i had my wife helping me but the only part were we were working on the same step at the same time was when we were placeing the seat onto the base, which i couldve done myself. I put the wheel on one base and my wife on the other, no difficulty there.<br /><br />The chair itself is larger and much better quality than i expected for $102. Initial sittings have been very comfortable. If for some reason the chair breaks or turns out to be utter junk in the near future i will come edit this review. but for now this seems to be a great chair for a great price",0.9766,positive

I didnt even break a nail. Lol! I used the same mattress from my old bed and went out and bought a mattress topper to make it a little more comfy until I get my memory foam mattress. I LOVE THIS BED!! I would absolutely recommend this bed. Very sturdy and it looks amazing in my room. The only tool you'll need is already included with the package. Awesome!

Safavieh Dallas Shag Collection SGD257A Dark Grey and Ivory Area Rug,Furniture,4,Shipping was fast and colors are true to those posted. No issue with shedding and is a nice rug.<br />My 4 star rating is based on the thickness of this rug. I purchased to put over ceramic flooring as my grandson is now pulling himself up and learning to walk. The floor is so hard it scares me. The pile posted on this is wrong in my opinion. I have purchased a few other Safavieh rugs which are extremely plush and thick. This is not and more like a 1/2 inch pile rather than the posted 2 inch.

He did put on a very sad face when it was time to go home and the Seater totter had to stay at Grandpa's house. But he'll be thrilled again when he returns, and he does live close.<br /><br />The item is very sturdy, should last through Frankie and his sibling as yet unborn. Bright colors attract a kid. The height is right for the child to be able to get on and off safely without help. Frankie even mastered the tipping of 90 degrees to turn the rocker into a seat after only 2 attempts. It's a popular place now to sit and/or rock in front of the TV with his favorite DVD playing. The DVD is also one that stays at Papa and Nana's.<br /><br />No choking hazards seem possible once the item is fully assembled, and that task is fast and easy. Weatherproof so it's good for inside and outside use.  Perhaps not an educational toy, but it sure is fun for a small child. Make it educational by letting a child sit or rock while reading to him/her. Or draw pictures while seated. Grandson Frankie gave it a full 5 squeals and smiles of delight.",0.9931,positive

There are complaints about the others bending and becoming useless. This one has a welded square tube platform and appeared more substantial. It arrived and I was setting it up which is relatively easy. The welds didn't seem that great, but I'm not sure how it will hold up over time. There are corner braces for the legs as well as braces connecting the two sets of center legs. Everything fit on one side well. The other side the braces are tight and one of the corner braces didn't line up. I measured the center to center distance between the pivoting point bolt hole for the leg and the brace attachment hole on each corner. All are 3.75&#34;  the one that didn't fit is 4&#34;. I really didn't want to send it back so I used a Dremel tool to elongate the brace attachment hole to attain the 3.75&#34; distance. I got the brace to fit and that leg is much sturdier.

Lipper International Child's Chalkboard Desk and Chair Set,Furniture,5,"I ordered two desks for my twin 3 1/2 year old girls. They are enrolled in the Kumon enrichment program so they have worksheets to do every single day. I really wanted to order desks in order to provide a very specific place that is especially designated for homework, only. Previously we were using the kitchen table.<br /><br />The desks were extremely easy to put together. It comes with a little allen wrench, wooden dowels and screws. All you need is scissors to open the packaging and you are good to go. Took about half an hour from start to finish. In fact, on the second desk I had both of the girls \\""help\\"" me. I read the directions and they would bring me the necessary number of screws and dowels. :) VERY solid pieces of wood. I was tightening the screw of a piece on one chair when I cracked the wood, but it was probably more my fault for overtightening than faulty product(I'm a short little Mommy, so it doesn't take much or a 200 lb Daddy to tighten too hard and crack the wood lol). I didn't run into any issues like previous posters where I had to custom create some parts. Everything came together perfectly.<br /><br />The twins are IN LOVE with the desks. Since I only allow them to sit at it for homework time, they always want and beg to do homework so they can sit at their desks. Each girl is about 3 feet tall. Their feet do not touch flat on the floor but its not uncomfortable at all. They wiggle around so much at that age anyways :). So I know they have some room to grow. In fact, when I was assembling the desk, there are two sets of screw holes on the side of the desk. The direction illustrate to screw in the legs of the desk at the higher set of holes. Although there is no notes in the directions as to the purpose of the second row of screw holes...I am assuming that maybe if we wanted to adjust the desk and screw in the legs into the bottom row of screw holes, that it would then make the desk higher for when the child is taller. I will post pictures so you can see how an average (well one is average size and the other a little underaverage size) 3 1/2 year old fits in the desk.n average (well one is average size and the other a little underaverage size) 3 1/2 year old fits in the desk.",0.9566,positive
Convenience Concepts Sheridan Faux Leather Storage Bench with 2 Side Ottomans,Furniture,4,"Just got this item today.<br />First impressions:  The workmanship may not be superb but it's more than acceptable.  They're comfortable to sit on (including the 2 stools).  They're certainly perfect footstools.  The removable top of the larger unit can be flipped to expose the 15.5&#34; X 33&#34; tray.  The tray also provides the hard backing so that when topside, the cover is comfortable and safe to use as a seat.<br />Cons:  (1)  I guess as a cost-cutting technique, the ottoman & the 2 footstools do not have hard sidewalls.  One must be careful stuffing the ottoman.<br />(2)  The 2 footstools have no hard backing so when sitting on it your butt kinda sinks.  I don't think these items should be used as seats too often.<br /><br />All in all, this is a good product for the price.",0.9848,positive

SystemBuild Kendall Storage Cabinet,Furniture,1,"This cabinet is constructed of very low quality materials. The back is just a piece of cardboard -- similar to the cardboard used to make cardboard boxes. The cabinet is designed to be held up by a piece or flakeboard extending across the top back of the cabinet. This design is so poor that I attached a substantial support for the cabinet to the wall below the cabinet extending for the entire width of the cabinet. Now, the cabinet will not fall off the wall and should be able to support the weight of the laundry products we use.<br /><br />The pair of two right doors rub against each other when the doors are closed or opened. The hinges are difficult to adjust. The cabinet is now installed. In my opinion the quality does not match the description. It shoulde sell for about $40, Don't purchase it.",-0.2226,negative

Dorel Home Products Rosewood Table,Furniture,4,"I purchased this table to place in a hallway.  I had limited space -- it had to fit between two nearly adjacent doors, and it could not be too deep because of a pull-down ladder for attic access.  This fits within what I needed, at almost 28 inches wide, almost 12 inches deep, and almost 28 inches high.  I say 'almost' because all three dimensions are perhaps between 1/32 and 1/8 inch short of those measurements.<br /><br />The price was reasonable when I purchased it.  A week in either direction, however, and the price was rather higher.  I would suggest watching for a while if you are interested, and purchasing it when the price is lower.<br /><br />It looks good and feels reasonably sturdy when assembled.  It appears to be made mostly of solid wood, not particleboard, pressboard, strandboard, or some other form of a compressed sawdust plus glue mix (the drawer bottom is the only piece that does not seem to be solid wood).  The surface appears to be stained wood, rather than a cheap plastic (or worse, paper) veneer, but it does not seem to have any protective coating (just bare stained wood), so I would suggest not putting anything bearing liquids or that might tend to attract condensate on the table.  I doubt it would ever be 'heirloom' quality, but I can see the table filling its function (standing in a hallway holding some small items) for a long time without problems.<br /><br />Because is is so tall (28 inches) but not very deep (12 inches), it is not the most stable place to put something.  I would not recommend putting easily broken objects on top, especially in a house where it might get bumped or shaken.  The manufacturer also seems to recommend keeping the load on the table (probably this includes the drawer contents) to less than 20 pounds (and I would not advise loading the drawer heavily).  It feels like it could possibly hold more, but I think that between its short depth and the manufacturing tolerances, stability could be an issue.<br /><br />The packaging was good, with most parts wrapped individually, and the hardware pieces (screws, handle, slider) attached to a single card.  The box was double-layered (the outside box and then another similar layer inside to protect the wood in case the outside box was damaged).  The assembly went easily and quickly; the instructions were simple.  On assembling the drawer, I would advise you to ensure the bottom piece is in place before you screw the sides to the front, since otherwise it is too easy for things to get out of alignment (plus it will make it easier to keep the drawer 'square').<br /><br />I took off one star because of some issues.<br /><br />One problem has to do with those measurement tolerances I mentioned earlier -- it seems like all of the tolerances allow 1/8 inch (or possibly a bit more) variance.  For example, on mine, all but one leg had a gap between its top and the bottom of the upper surface, with one leg over 1/8 inch, two about 1/8, and the remaining leg backed almost flush to the surface.  You can't see these gaps normally, but it felt like these large manufacturing tolerances were everywhere.  I have it sitting on carpet, where it seems okay, but it clearly wobbles on a hard floor, so the legs really do come down different distances from the top (though they all might be the same length, the way they mount varied too much).<br /><br />Another issue has to do with how the parts are labelled.  Normally, the stickers labelling parts are kind of like Post-It notes: they stay in place during shipping but come off easily during assembly.  Unhappily, the stickers used on this seemed permanent.  The stickers took considerable work to remove without damaging the finish, and even then left glue behind that required further surface cleaning.  Since this was so much trouble (or could have left damage in clearly visible places if done poorly), I figured it was worth mentioning.  It would be possible to move most of the poorly placed stickers to places where they would not be an issue (such as the top end of the legs), but some of the stickers would still be visible, so I think it would be better if they used a different glue on the stickers that label the parts.<br /><br />The drawer includes a slider that suspends the back of the drawer from an overhead rail (rather than having rails below the drawer to support it).  However, I did not see any pads on the front of the unit where the bottom of the drawer will rest.  A teflon pad on each side of the bottom of the opening would make it far more durable (so you could open and close the drawer and not wear into the wood); additional teflon pads on the sides would help keep the drawer straight and avoid jamming the slider.  Thankfully, there is enough of a gap around the drawer that it will not be hard to add such pads using some self-stick teflon tape.<br /><br />If it had not been for these issues, I think it would have been five stars.ere they would not be an issue (such as the top end of the legs), but some of the stickers would still be visible, so I think it would be better if they used a different glue on the stickers that label the parts.<br /><br />The drawer includes a slider that suspends the back of the drawer from an overhead rail (rather than having rails below the drawer to support it).

6-Piece Wood Dining Set with Bench,Furniture,5,"We have a house that is almost 100 years old with dark wood trim and this table looks like it was made for the room.  My husband is mechanically inclined and it took him about 3 hours to assemble, nothing complex, but to quote him \\""the chairs were in 100 pieces.\\""  Just be aware, it may take you some time to put together. That being said, and the fact that I did not have to put it together, it is GORGEOUS.  Nothing feels cheap about this, you would think it cost 3 or 4 times what we paid.  It is our first real dining set and I think it will be around for a long long time.  Make sure someone is home for delivery because the packaging is huge and heavy and you will want to bring it in right away.  I would recommend this table to anyone, we are so in love with it!  One last comment...we are leaving the leaf in, just because it seems a little odd shaped without it and the ends of the table are not out very far for the heads of the table to sit closely.  If you have a big people in your family, this table would probably only sit 6, but if you have some kids mixed in there, 8 could probably work. 100% IN LOVE WITH THIS TABLE SET!",0.9863,positive

Winsome Townsend Bench with Cushion,Furniture,4,"My husband and I purchased this as a place for guests to sit and remove their shoes. The cubbies are large and easy to reach. The cushion isn't super soft and plush but for us doesn't need to be to achieve its purpose.

Bob 5-in-1 Wobble Clock,Furniture,4,"I really like this little wobble clock. It's small and will fit anywhere and has a weighted base for stability.

Calendar - Year, Month and Day  4. Countdown Timer - Adjustable from 1 second up to 99 minutes, 59 seconds  5. Alarm      However I rated this item 4 stars because it eats batteries like crazy. Even using excellent brands like Duracell or Energizer made no difference. Now I just use the $1.00 Sunbeams from the dollar store or the 99 cent Rayovacs from Wally World.",0.8777,positive

Only complaint I have so far is that for some reason that containers looked deeper from the picture, but the toys dont seem to be &#34;in&#34; the containers. More of that towards the end.<br /><br />Because of the way it is designed, it is slightly difficult to put the container back in the same location its taken out from, once it is fully arranged. You may ask why it needs to be taken out once arranged - let me put you through to my 2 year old. He can explain and my guess is you will be satisfied with his answer, I know I am. :)<br /><br />Also, the toys seem to be falling off the container, again because of the way it was designed.

"Sauder Sewing Craft Cart, Cinnamon Cherry Finish",Furniture,5,"I bought this for my occasional crafts hobby. But it turned out so useful with big divided bins on your left that are great for pens and stationary, I've been using it everyday as a computer desk to work at home.   The quality of the wood and parts are more than I expected from the price. Each board is very sturdy, and was labeled clearly. The holes where screws go in were well marked and pre-made, so I didn't need elbow grease or electric drill -- all I needed was usual plus and minus screw drivers and a small hammer. I'm a skinny woman without much muscles, but built the desk on my own in 2-3 hours. If you have built furniture from Ikea, you can build this desk easily, and with much less (or no) blisters. Sauder packaged it extremely well -- they put \\""Sauder package protection guards\\"" at each side so that corners wouldn't get damaged accidentally during delivery.   Some nice features I discovered only during putting this desk together were follows:  1. Each door securely close with magnets placed at the top corner.   2. Inside the right-side door has two adjustable shelves -- you can choose from 15 levels of hight.   3. The two plastic bins attached inside the left-side door are detachable -- tighten the screws all the way, and loose them back just a little. The bins stay there securely, but also can be easily taken off by just pulling them up. They stand as themselves on the desk, even you fill the bins with tons of pens! Also the bins have 5 each compartments -- or you can remove the dividers to accommodate bigger stuff.   4. The bins have a BIG capacity! Each is about 4x4x4 inches, 5 per bin, and two bins come in with a desk.   5. Two front rolling feet have locks, so you can keep the desk stable when needed.  6. Top of the left door has a secure bar to keep the folding table in place when in use.   7. The bottom shelf in middle is also perfect as a foot rest while working on the desk.   I really recommend this table for everyone who long for a nice spacious desk with organizing feature but want to hide it compact at snap when they have a sudden guest.",0.9953,positive

Leather Armrest Organizer,Furniture,2,"The look of it is fine - definitely more attractive than other caddies. The functionality leaves something to be desired.  The &#34;grips&#34; on the reverse side do not do the job of holding the caddy in place, even when empty.  The side without the pockets would need to be tucked under a cushion to hold the caddy in place and, depending on the deepness of your cushions, it may not be long enough to tuck.  Might be best used bedside, tucked between mattress and box spring.  Holds at least 3 remotes, 4 if they are narrow, but not much else.  Has a pungent odor that has not completely dissipated in the week that I've had it.

I may make some chair pads with non slip material.  The backs are shorter than I thought they would be and as I ordered clear they don't add much accent to the room from the counter side.  All that said they go pretty well with our modern kitchen look.<br /><br />One item of note is the metal 'disc' that is between the seat and the upper part of the stool will 'dent' when you tighten the screws from the lever mechanism that moves the chair up and down.

The mattress was so.... not dense? I literally could step through it and I'm 110lbs. I bought this bed for my 10 month old daughter and it is actually serving it's purpose quite nicely. The mattress is low enough to the floor so she can crawl off it herself, we had been cosleeping and my bed was much too high it was giving me a heart attack. So she sleeps on this mattress on the floor next to the wall and my bed. Nice and safe! She's sleeping great on the mattress too. I found it uncomfortable at first but my body does not ache at all if I have to sleep on it with her for an extended amount of time. My mind THINKS it is uncomfortable but I don't think it really is. It feels flimsy, but it's working for us. I don't have a truck and this was delivered to my door in a box, in 2 days from across the country. I think I got a good deal all and all.

Alera Ravino Big and Tall Series High-Back Swivel/Tilt Leather Chair,Furniture,1,"I bought this chair in February, 2011. The first problem I had was that the wrong chair back was in the box. The manufacturer replaced it.<br /><br />The second problem is that even when siting all the way back in chair, my head is still six inches away from the headrest.<br /><br />Since the chair frame is sturdy, the seat was reasonable comfortable, and I mistakenly thought it was real leather, I kept it.<br /><br />However, what is described as leather on the seat and back, turned out to be a very thin film of vinyl on a fabric backing. After just over two years, this thin film of vinyl started to peel off. First in small flakes, then in larger strips. The seating area is only guaranteed for 24 months, so I was out of luck, even though they are falsely describing this as a leather chair.<br /><br />The thin pieces of vinyl are sticking to my back and legs and falling off all over the place. I tried covering the seat and back with towels for the last six months. This did not work.<br /><br />The chair looks terrible and is a pain to have to keep vacuuming up all the little pieces of vinyl that are all over the place. As soon as I can, I will replace it<br /><br />DO NOT GET THIS CHAIR. Even though the metal frame is well made and strong, the thin film of vinyl on the seat and back is a joke and does not last.<br /><br />I am upset that this chair was described as leather when it most definitely is NOT.<br /><br />If you read this review and still buy this chair, you will deserve the pealing mess you will wind up with in a few years.",-0.701,negative

"Sauder Sewing Craft Cart, Cinnamon Cherry Finish",Furniture,3,"I didn't expect too much from this product, given the price point, and that it's typical Sauder style and quality. The pre-fab boards with holes didn't line up correctly once assembled. I thought assembly was pretty easy and it didn't take too long. Once together, the knobs didn't line up, so I had to remove them from the pre-made holes and move them so that the piece was presentable. A lot of the boards had chips. I'm going to contact Sauder to see if I can get one of the pieces replaced. The flap that pulls up to elongate the table is terribly chipped. It was packaged really well from the outside- I'm not sure how or when the chipping occurred. In the end, this is a temporary table for me.

I watched the videos twice (okay three times), then I figured that I had the top of the mattress on the bottom.  Fixed that problem. My daughter came and started assisting me.  We placed the side panels and top panels.  Placed the black foam on the bottom.  Placed the air pages on top of the black foam.  Place the tubes in the holes and hooked them to the device. place the cover on and zipped them up.  then the 2 foams.  then placed the top of the mattress cover on and zipped up.

Seriously? They had no way to simply send me the missing parts since they were the middleman. That was a little disappointing. I'm not going to box it up and send back such a heavy item. I'll just go to the hardware and buy a few nuts and bolts and fasten the frames together myself.Other than that it's still a decent frame, but it is made in China with apparently little or no quality control.",-0.4097,negative

It is made of a MDF and the base is a little small for it's height. If using on a carpeted floor it should be mounted to the wall for stability. The manufacture recommends mounting it in all cases but I find it is very stable on my tiled floor. I would give it 4.5 stars because of the base.<br /><br />Anyone who is familiar with assembling prepackaged furniture (e.g. Ikea) will find that this is simple to put together. My wife and I assembled this in about 35 minutes. The box is heave and the shelf is bulky when assembling so I recommend 2 people for assembly. Make sure to put it together in the room you wan't it in. It is wide and may not be able to turn around corners very well.,0.9427,positive

Herman Miller Classic Aeron Task Chair: Tilt Limiter w/Seat Angle Adj - PostureFit Support - Fully Adj Vinyl Arms - Standard Carpet Casters,Furniture,1,"I bought this chair with the idea that it would provide significant lower back support and unfortunately, it provides very little.  The reason is simple, the posture fit device is a seven inch high pad without any contour and made out of soft foam.  As a result, it does not provide any meaningful support by following or supporting the curvature of the lumbar area.<br /><br />To illustrate the issue, simply contrast the design of the posture fit device with that of the lumbar pad that aeron provides on other chairs - the lumbar pad is 4 1/2 inches tall, which is more appropriate for the lumbar region - and it is logically rounded and made out of firmer material.  The designs are very different, so there is no reason to believe that both would be effective in providing lower back support.<br /><br />I contacted the company that made the sale (Office Designs) and they responded:<br />\\""You are correct the PostureFit is not meant to provide lower back support.  The purpose of the PostureFit is to aid in creating proper alignment of the spine.\\""  I have no idea how something that is supposed to aid in the proper alignment of the spine would not provide lumbar support.<br /><br />As if that is not bizarre enough, they state on their website that \\""PostureFit is a major ergonomic revolution in seating that provides custom-fitted support where it is needed most: in the lower back, below the beltline, where the spine meets the pelvis.\\""  So according to their website, it is supposed to provide lower back support.<br /><br />I thought that I was investing in a great chair that would ensure that I would receive good back support, unfortunately, that is far from the case.  I would highly recommend that you avoid the posturefit device, and if you feel the need to buy an aeron chair, ensure that it has a lumbar pad - more generally I would buy a chair from a company that does not try to pretend that the posturefit contraption provides lower back support.<br /><br />For the cost of the chair, we deserve far better.e chair, we deserve far better.",0.9704,positive

Home Styles Naples Student Desk - White,Furniture,4,"Solid desk for the price.  My 5 year old wanted a desk for her room and we weren't ready just yet to invest in any quality furniture for her, well, since she's only 5!  We knew the desk would most likely take a beating from dings, spills, art supplies, etc...so we went with this lower cost option.  I have to say I am pleasantly surprised with the quality of the desk.  It's solid wood all around and is pretty well made.  Had a minor issue with one of the support beams under the desk assembly as there was a minor crack in it, but it's not visible and does not affect the overall integrity of the desk's build.  Assembly was a breeze.  The desk after assembly was very level with no adjustments necessary, but there are little feet screwed into the bottom of the legs that allow you to screw/unscrew them to level the legs.  Drawers slide very easy and were also level.  After about a month of use, no major dings or scratches in the desk, which is pretty good consider how much she uses it.",0.9253,positive
Wetlook Bean Bag,Furniture,3,"When I first purchased this product I was extremely pleased. I read lots of reviews and found this to be one of the best beanbags out there. I am alittle over 6 feet tall and have no problem laying in this, and my girlfriend who is about 5ft 3 can also use it easily as well. This is definitely what I would consider an \\""adult\\"" beanbag. The outside \\""skin\\"" is great, it is nice and smooth and I love the look of the black. In addition, I love the pear shape to it since it provides an amazing amount of support, which just makes it that much more comfortable.<br /><br />But the problem with all these new beanbags is that they no longer contain the plastic beans we are familiar with. Instead, this beanbag has these sort of styrofoam balls, almost like packing peanuts. Don't get me wrong, the beanbag is very comfortable, but the stuffing just does not last. Granted, we probably have used this beanbag about everyday, but now it is too deflated. When you sit on it, your bottom always ends up hitting the floor. It is still comfortable however, as it does provide you with support, but its just not the same. They do have packing refills on Amazon, but they cost about $20, and from those reviews I see that its not very much packing to begin with...If you tend on using it occasionally, then its probably a good buy for you, but if you are looking it to be a common furniture item then maybe you should look for something with more sturdy packing material.",0.9883,positive

Perfect Cloud Atlas Gel-Plus 10-Inch Memory Foam Mattress - Amazon Exclusive Model Featuring New Gel Cool Visco - 10 Year Hassle-Free Warranty,Furniture,4,"It came on time and was easy to set up.  It was kind of fun watching it expand.  I couldn't not do it by myself and needed help to get it on the bed. If you purchase this bed be sure that it's on the bed correctly before it inflates. It would be quite difficult to turn it over after.    It did have a slight smell, but it wasn't overpowering, and my husband couldn't even smell it.  I'm sensitive to smells and have a tendency for headaches, so I was really worried about buying this bed.  However, my husband moves around a lot in his sleep, and I really wanted to find a solution for us, so I took the chance.  I let it air our for three days.  There was still a slight smell at that time, but it didn't bother me, and I did not get a headache.    We have been sleeping on it for a couple of weeks now, and it works well.  It doesn't seem like there is any gel in it though. I'm not sure what I expected from the gel, but it all feels like foam.  Maybe that's how it's supposed to be?    We put it on top of our regular box spring mattress and that seems to work okay. It does have a tendency to slide around a bit.  About every two days I have to adjust the mattress and straighten the bed curtain on the box springs. It's not a huge problem, but it does happen consistently.    As for comfort, both my husband and I think it's very comfortable, and it's not as \\""hard\\"" as it was when we first got it. That's okay, but I hope that doesn't mean it's going to continue to get softer over time. It's perfect now.  I'll just have to wait awhile to see what happens. It does cut down on transfer motion. I do not feel my husband moving around as much.  Problem is the bed frame itself does move, but that's not the mattress's fault.  The mattress would probably do much better on a frame meant for a foam mattress, and it would likely solve the sliding around problem I mentioned previously.    The bed looks exactly as pictured, and it the cover is sewn well over the mattress.    It seemed a bit silly to buy a bed online, but so far it's working out.",0.9887,positive

South Shore Versa 6-Drawer Double Dresser,Furniture,2,"I bought this over 4 months ago.  It was a pain to put together (egad) but it was cheap and looked presentable.  The drawers did not shut well and there was a little bit of a gap between all center drawers, but it was ok if you didn't look too closely.  And it was cheap.    Please note that when I finished the assembly, I finished it in place of where it was located for the last few months.  I went to move it yesterday and pushed a little bit on it and the whole thing collapsed.  It didn't just twist a little or groan, it totally fell apart.  I must admit I'm dumbfounded that it could have fallen apart that easily.  So beware - don't plan on moving it at all - not even a few inches without two very strong  men to pick it up and move it (even then it might be risky).  By the way - with the particle board used this thing is very heavy and not easily moved.

"Chirp Jewelry Armoire, 47""Hx16""Wx12""D, PEWTER",Furniture,5,"I asked for and got this for Christmas, in ivory.  It came fom a local home decor store (though I found it on Amazon). I love it.  My old jewelry box was crammed, so much so that I once bought the same bracelet twice without realizing it for months!<br /><br />I was somewhat concerned as other reviews had mentioned an odor (and the one on display at the store was too high to sniff), but mine does not have one.  If I stick my head in a drawer, I can smell something, but nothing you wouldn't smell normally from sticking your nose right up against something.<br /><br />It is sturdy and well-made, with smooth drawer and door movement.  I researched quite a bit before choosing this one, reading reviews on various sites, and they agreed it is better constructed than MANY of the other armoires available, so I didn't expect to be disappointed on that score.  Added bonus:  It comes completely put together.<br /><br />Reviews had said that it did not have straps to keep necklaces from swaying when opening the doors, but when I dragged my husband to the local store to view one before deciding on it, that one did have straps.  Alas, the one I got did not.  Maybe they used to put them on and that was an older one on display.  So that was a minor disappointment, but very minor.  It is not really problematic; it's just that the straps would be even better.  I could use more necklace hangers, but the very few armoires that have more weren't as good looking or as well-reviewed.  So I just doubled up hanging the necklaces.<br /><br />The bird decoration is subtle and classy.  I love it.  I think the other two colors look great, too; the ivory just went with my furniture better.  I can imagine the other two would look just as beautiful with other types and colors of decor.  A quality piece, and aesthetically pleasing.<br /><br />I don't have that much jewelry, but even so, it was jammed in the largish jewelry box I had (which I gave to my daughter).  Now I can see everything!  As others cautioned, only the top section, under the lift-up mirror, has dividers - but again, that seems to be common in armoires.  As I don't have many rings, I put my earrings in the ring slots and in the compartments in that top section.  The next drawers going down contain:  Pins, bracelets, more bracelets, empty drawer, scarves, gloves, and more gloves.  I can easily see every jewelry piece!  I see no need to get containers to go in the drawers as one reviewer did, but of course that is a good organizing option, too.<br /><br />It is going to be great to have my gloves so easily accessible, instead of in a box on the closet shelf.  Of course, I obviously need to shop for  more jewelry, as there is still an empty drawer!<br /><br />You can tell how much I love this, as I have reviewed it on the day I got it.",0.9954,positive

The colors are perfect and the details are very nice.  The only problem is the strong smell. It is horrible. We have had this rug for 4 weeks and I bought it for my baby sons room. The odor is so strong, I have left the windows open with the ceiling fans on and the smell still won't go away. We eventually had to remove it from his room because it is so stinky. Now it's in a big open room and the smell is still there.  Not sure what to do. But it is so cute and I don't want to return it, I'm just hoping the smell goes away very soon.",0.9431,positive

Winsome Wood Sasha Accent Table with Drawer Curved Legs,Furniture,5,"I'm always reluctant to buy furniture that has to be assembled but for this price, I dove right in!  You can fin a step-by-step assembly video on my YouTube channel.  Assembly was simple for one person.  There was one part of the assembly process that felt a little sketchy though.  That was sliding in the bottom shelf.  I was afraid that it might scratch the legs but it didn't.  My best advice there is to keep the legs somewhat loose until the bottom shelf is inserted and then tighten all of the legs.  Once completely assembled, the table is very sturdy!  It has exceeded my expectations!  I was expecting a table of much less quality and am thoroughly impressed.  I would buy again if I needed more.  I got this in conjunction with the club chair for one of my virtual sets.  It looks great and is plenty large to rest a laptop on top or other small items.  Sure the weight is not as heavy as expensive pre-assembled furniture that you may buy at a furniture store but it's a notch above most DIY assembly furniture from the big box retailers in my opinion.",0.8659,positive
"Altra Jensen TV Stand for TVs up to 47""",Furniture,1,"Package did not show any damage, but top had large crack on bottom on one end small crack on other end, also another item had minor corner damage,some hardware was missing. Top finished side had poor finish around edge. Very hard to get proper fit. Back side & under side unfinished, which would allow moisture to get in and cause damage to press wood construction. Very heavy product. I would not purchase this product if I had it to do over again. However,as with all Amazon purchases they took care of my concern<br /><br />Update:  I did get this item put together a week or so after posting the above review. I placed slides under the feet so item could be moved on carpet, installed equipment on selves, but did not placed TV on stand. When I went to slowly slide item to final location, it fell like dominons with me on top of it. I was lucky no injury to myself or equipment.  Worse product I ever seen.",0.8712,positive

My son has it on his new bunk bed which has metal bars instead of the (in my opinion) preferable wood slats/bunkie board and still this mattress holds us both without making it feel as though we are lying across... well, metal bars.<br /><br />I only gave 4 stars because I don't think it is preferable to a regular mattress, but it will definitely do the job for us. Do note, though, that I would rate it as a firm mattress - just because it is foam doesn't mean you will melt right into it.

I love a good strong cup of coffee and I love my Keurig brewer.  But I am a cheapskate at heart and hated paying the price for the regular K-cups. This is a great compromise.<br />Since it does not have the plastic cup base and is just a round filter hanging from the top ring, you have to keep them sealed in a zip-lock or similar air tight container or they will not stay fresh.  That is a small inconvenience I can live with.  They also reduce our use of plastic and the trash we generate and I suspect that there may be health benefits from not brewing the coffee in the little plastic cup.",0.8204,positive

Krusteaz Fat Free Honey Cornbread Mix,Grocery,5,"All of the Krusteaz products we have tried smell wonderful when baking, and their taste meets the expectation that the wonderful baking fragrance sets you up for.  This Honey Cornbread mix is no exception - the bread has a great texture, light but not overly crumbly, and it has a nice hint of honey with a very good corn taste... and this mix is very easy to make. It cooks to a great crisped exterior with a hot, soft interior and we do the following to enhance the end result:<br /><br />1. Substitute melted butter for the oil<br /><br />2. Add about 1/3 can of drain cooked corn and fold it in gently<br /><br />3. Cook the minimum of the suggested time range (which is 22 - 26 minutes). We are at sea level and find that 21 - 22 minutes is just right to maximize the exterior crispness with interior moistness. Any more and the cornbread dries out too much for our liking.<br /><br />We found Krusteaz products purely by luck; one day we were short on time but had friends coming over, and we wanted to make a nice dessert item that would be good with after-dinner coffee and would make the house smell really nice for their arrival. That product was the Crumb Cake ([[ASIN:B004IY1MRY Krusteaz Cinnamon Crumb Cake]]) and we were hooked from that day forward!<br /><br />Since finding Krusteaz, we've branched out a bit to their other products and have found these to really be wonderful too: Belgian Waffle Mix ([[ASIN:B003BQPZGE Krusteaz Waffle Mix]]), Wild Blueberry Muffins ([[ASIN:B00APP0M3K Krusteaz Wild Blueberry Muffin Mix]]), Blueberry Pancakes ([[ASIN:B004IXYLQO Krusteaz Blueberry Pancake Mix]]) and the Pumpkin Pie Bars ([[ASIN:B008F8VFBC Krusteaz Pumpkin Pie Bar]]). Am sure that we will find more to our liking too...<br /><br />We completely and absolutely recommend this cornbread mix and other Krusteaz product, and know that you will enjoy them as much as we do.<br /><br />Go for it and enjoy!",0.9973,positive

SodaStream SodaMix,Grocery,2,"This flavor tastes pretty similar to Red Bull, but it doesn't have nearly the same amount of caffeine.  Only 30mg per serving vs 80mg in a typical off the shelf energy drink.  The Crystal Light Energy flavor actually claims to have 60mg, which is much closer to being on par.  So a fruity diet drink aimed at Soccer Moms actually does a better job at &#34;giving you wings&#34; than the flavor claiming to replace the original energy drink brand.  To be clear, Doctors recommend no more than 400mg of caffeine per day.  So you would have to drink about a gallon's worth of this flavor to get to that cap.  If you want to take the entire liter bottle of your soda to work with you, you will have to drink the entire bottle to get as much caffeine as a single 8oz cup of coffee.  Bottom line, this flavor is really pointless, unless you are obsessed with the flavor of Red Bull and plan to drink it like water.",0.9705,positive

The marinade does harden on the outside of the meat during grilling, so that can make chopping the meat the next day a chore.

I decided to give this product a try for all the iced tea that I like to drink in the summer. I can tell you that this is an excellent product to use not only in cold drinks, but any liquid drink. There is no bitterness, and I add 8 to 10 drops for a 16oz. tea. I like that the product does not contain alcohol. I carry a bottle in my purse and keep one at home. DON'T HESITATE to buy this product. If you are currently a Stevia user, you will absolutely love this product. For those of you just starting out using a natural sweetener, give it a good month to get use to Stevia. Stevia is not sugar, nor does it taste like sugar. It took me a month to get use to the flavor of Stevia years ago, but now I can't drink anything with sugar as it is just too sweet. I will never go back to sugar or artificial sweeteners.

This is probably because I prefer bold and full bodied coffees.  I was told by one of their employees  their secret is they use 30% - 40% more coffee than the competition.  Since they were acquired by Green Mountain Coffee, who is buying up all the K-cup makers, this brand is going downhill quickly.  It is probably because the profit margin is less because of the extra coffee needed to make their brand special.  They used to have at least 10 different blends, now they are down to four.  They have done away with three of the best flavors, Organic, French Roast, and Santa's Buzz (seasonal).

"Viva Naturals Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, 16 Ounce",Grocery,5,"This is excellent coconut oil. The primary reason I got this was for my popcorn machine, but I have since started using it elsewhere.<br /><br />Coconut oil has many uses...and when I say &#34;many&#34; I means THOUSANDS. It can benefit health from consumption, it can make good foods taste better, provide skin care, provide hair care, lubricate and protect porus materials needing an oil sealant, make popcorn kernels pop more efficiently, flavor beverages, and then some. There are so many applications that it is impossible to touch on them all, so my review focuses on two...<br /><br />POPCORN<br />I LOVE using this for popcorn. I find kernels tend to pop more consistently (pop more at the same time) and it reduces ones which do not pop. It also gives a sweet undertone to the popcorn, which other oils do not, and this works well with salted, spiced, flavored, sweet/salty, and kettle corn popcorn. In other words, it makes all popcorn taste better. Even better is that you can use it as a topping to compliment or replace melted better, and this is a much healthier oil. A little of this and crystal salt and you will be in heaven.<br /><br />HIGH-HEAT COOKING<br />I like to sear the heck out of certain foods at extremely high heat, and I like to broil others at 500+F. As you probably know, many oils are not ideal for this due to lower smoke points (and while this is NOT high enough heat to cause an oil to break down, it is enough to change the flavor negatively). Coconut oil is a great match for high-heat cooking, and it gives it's own unique flavor to food. If I am searing a steak, I now will paint it in coconut oil instead of butter or olive oil, then season it with salt, pepper, and thyme for a high-heat sear. I think it tastes even better with the coconut oil.<br /><br />I could also discuss the health benefits of coconut oil, but many others have already noted this. Still, I am impressed how this coconut oil further helps eliminate my use of unhealthy fats, and how it often tastes even better than them.t often tastes even better than them.",0.9981,positive

Don't think that your friends or family who are not making similar dietary choices--even those who otherwise love dark chocolate--will necessarily appreciate this chocolate, though.

"Gia Russa Artichoke Bruschetta Topping, 10-Ounce Glass Jars (Pack of 3)",Grocery,1,"I had always liked this product but it has become impossible to eat. The product is filled with roughage similar to straw, debris & weeds. You constantly have to pick out the inedible debris. A substantial amount. At least half the jar is debris. This was not limited to a single lot. Every jar & every lot was just the same. Constantly picking out the roughage. There is no excuse for this abominable situation. Especially at the prices they charge. Until Gia Russa starts filtering out the roughage, I would recommend boycotting this product. This is quite intolerable & nearly inedible.<br /><br />Their sweet pepper bruschetta is still excellent as an alternative, but I recommend avoiding this artichoke product unless you enjoy wasting money on a substandard, inedible product. There is no excuse for Gia Russa not filtering out the roughage from this product. It is quite inedible. We are talking About roughage up to 1 inch in size. Like pieces of straw. I'm surprised the FDA doesn't have an issue with this. I'm not entirely sure it is safe to eat the roughage in this product. It caused me extreme gastrointestinal distress even after I removed as much roughage as I could.<br /><br />I hope that others who find the same will also speak up. It is the only way they will fix it. Anyone who defends this situation would obviously be connected with the distribution or company in some manner. There is no defense. For this many lots & jars, (I brought 12), to be filled with roughage like this means they either don't care about their product or have a terrible quality control or bad filtering methods. No excuse for this.... and yes the quality seals were intact. This is also not the first time.",0.9094,positive

We put aloe on her to soothe it and luckily the effects were gone within a couple of hours, but I'm out almost 10 dollars and will never use this again!  If you really want to use this, I recommend testing a small area of skin first to see if you have a reaction.

"Viva Naturals Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, 16 Ounce",Grocery,5,"When Viva Labs offered to send me a review sample of their Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, I didn't know what I was getting into. \\""Sure,\\"" I replied, \\""I'll be glad to test it out and write a review.\\"" At the time, I thought my wife and I could evaluate the oil during one of our weekend ethnic cooking marathons. Wrong! Well, partially wrong. Yes, you can cook with Viva Labs Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil. But, based on the blurb here and the label on the jar, that's apparently just a minor sideline. What this oil is really intended for, we found out, is to smear all over your skin and hair, and/or to take neat as a dietary supplement.<br /><br />Ain't gonna happen. We've never been fans of skin and hair care products other than plain soap and water, and the idea of downing tablespoons full of thick oil creeps both of us out. So I'm forced to acknowledge that the sum total of our experience with this product is simply cooking with it. Even so, it sat in our kitchen for a few months until we got around to trying it as a frying and saut&eacute;ing substitute for the extra virgin olive oil that we normally use.<br /><br />So how does it work in that limited application? Well, we tried it yesterday to brown some really lean ground feral swine meat and other ingredients for Cuban picadillo, and to lightly saut&eacute; some shrimp for our Super Bowl snacks. We found it works great for cooking. It melts almost instantly in the skillet, and does a good job of cooking onions to transparency, for example. It generated virtually no fond, however, which can be either good or bad, depending on what you're looking for. We had the heat set fairly low for our experiments, so we didn't get really deep browning of either the meat or the shrimp.<br /><br />To our tastes, Viva Labs Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil is relatively light, despite the fact that it's solid at room temperature, and it imparts a subtle, but noticeable and quite pleasant, coconut quality to the foods we fried in it. Overall, we're very pleased with it, and we'll use the rest of it in the future as a viable alternative to other cooking oils. We expect its coconut character to be especially appropriate and deliciously discernible when we make South American, Carribbean or African meals.<br /><br />I'll leave it up to others to say how well it works for skin and hair care and as a dietary supplement, but for cooking, it's a five-star product. Enjoy!l, we're very pleased with it, and we'll use the rest of it in the future as a viable alternative to other cooking oils.

I tried the breakfast blend, which was very good, and also this Columbia Classico, which I am really enjoying. This is something I will definitely get again. It is smooth, rich, and a nice medium roast. It is not bitter or acidic. It just is a lovely basic coffee. This to me is what I think of when I think about having a regular ol' cup of GOOD coffee. I will have to try their decaf next because I have decaf every evening.<br /><br />This coffee is a nice medium, average roast (although I think it describes it as medium to dark). I think most average coffee drinkers would be on board with this. It does not taste too dark to me at all. It is just right. My husband has been enjoying the Community Coffees I've been trying too, and it's also a great price (at least here at amazon - I haven't checked the cost in the stores). We normally get Green Mountain and sometimes Folgers. Community Coffee will now also be on our go-to list.",0.9903,positive

Food to Live Fenugreek Seeds (Methi) (5 Pounds),Grocery,2,"I've never had Fenugreek before, so maybe it isn't fair to the manufacturer, but these got me sick. I tried them a two different ways-- in a tea and ground up in a smoothie.<br /><br />For the tea-- I didn't enjoy the flavor at all, but I'm OK with that if there s a health benefits but the only benefit I had is I felt a little off after the tea. Nothing too bad, but slightly dizzy. Maybe it gave me a low blood sugar, I'm not sure, but it seems like it could have been that. But the flavor was so strong, even sweetened with honey or mixed with other tea, I thought maybe I could add it to a smoothie with other flavors to mask it.<br /><br />For the smoothie- The flavor was more tolerable. Not good, but again, if I wanted something for the flavor I'd get a milkshake. I ground the whole thing up in a Vitamix. The seed was completely mixed in and undetectable. But it caused so much gastrointestinal  distress it was unbearable. I tried it 3 times to see if it was a fluke and the 3rd time I was in such much pain and running to the bathroom I was done with fenugreek.<br /><br />That said, some people react this way to fenugreek so I have no way of knowing if this brand is good or not. The item itself is well-packaged, the seeds are very clean, and the package came very quickly-- so that's a plus. If you can tolerate fenugreek, I'd say go by the other reviews which are very good. If you aren't sure, get a smaller bag.",0.6542,positive

"Columbia County Flax Granola, 12 oz",Grocery,5,"FYI, if you buy this granola specifically for The Plan, you only get 3 servings from one bag if you are a woman, and 2 servings if you are a man (The Plan guidelines allow for 1 cup granola for women and 1.5C for men).  The bag states &#34;12 servings&#34; in several places, which equates to approx 1/4C.  I thought it was important to note this for those of us doing The Plan - you'll want to buy as much as you need and not scramble at the last minute!  That being said, I love this granola and look forward to it in the mornings with blueberries and coconut milk.  I've made it myself according to the Plan recipe, but it's yummier if you buy it from Columbia County - theirs is crunchier and more toasted.",0.6867,positive

While I am a strong advocate of only buying products made in the U.S., until a mustard tasting this good is available from one of our companies, will continue buying these imported Thomy products.

One package goes a long way because the lower amount of sugar means your appetite is less stimulated and you taste the chocolate better than with Dove.  You may be able to find this at Wal-Mart for $1.00 less, but my local Wal-Mart is proving unreliable in stocking it.<br /><br />On the other hand, shipping for three bars ($18 worth of chocolate) is $15, so even if this is my favorite, and I can't get it in town, I'm not buying it.",0.9649,positive

Do your research before buying &#34;Natural&#34; sugars. I surprised by WHAT they put in these products and HOW they process them..., it's scary!

Cowboy Coffee Chew (Pack of 3) Quit Chewing Tin Can Non Tobacco Nicotine Free Smokeless Alternative to Dip Snuff Snus Leaf,Grocery,5,"This stuff is great!<br />I used to use snuff some years ago and quit, but I might have quit sooner had I had this stuff at the time.<br />The reason I bought it was to give me some energy at work and curve my hunger because I'm part time, and can't take lunch breaks. But after working 6 hours I tend to get hungry.<br />I've used it the past few days and its working exactly how I was hoping. It gives me a nice little boost of energy, and when I start to get hungry, a pinch will hold me over for...well as long as I keep it in my mouth. It also seems to help at home when I'm just sitting around and feel like snacking on stuff.<br />The taste is great. If you like the taste of coffee, buy it. It basically tastes like a coffee bean with sweetener and creamer flavor (which I'm pretty sure is, what it is.)<br />My only complaint; the tins aren't bigger. With as good as this stuff is, it won't be long before I've gone through all 3 tins. Truthfully though even if the tins were the size of Pringles cans it wouldn't be enough.<br />Will definitely buy again.",0.9939,positive

Gourmet Sea Salt Sampler Collection No. 1 & No. 2 - A Collection of 22 different Salts - Taste the World of Salt - Over a Pound of the best Gourmet Salt.,Grocery,4,"I'm a chemist so I guess the test tubes caught my eye. I've been perfecting my cooking skills and figuring out what to fill my pantry with. I was prone to scoff at fancy sea salt admirers but my father did once have me taste one of his friend's salt company salt, dug up somewhere in Utah that contained lots of minerals besides sodium and it was indeed more complex and interesting than normal salt. And smoked salt? What is that?! Well, to find out, even in NYC would have involved buying lots of big bottles of the stuff, likely over time so I would lack a real sense of whether I was missing out on something special.    That said, most of these taste about the same but may differ a bit in texture. Most are too coarse to imagine sprinkling on prepared food without grinding. The difference in coarseness makes wet finger dip comparisons imprecise. So I used a mortar to grind them for comparison. Most are not a harsh as normal table salt, but over half do translate to \\""just salt\\"" after an initial second long delay as a slight mineral taste is noticed (perhaps!). I say perhaps, since no, few of the unsmoked ones taste noticeably different than normal salt. Even the pitch black unsmoked one (a great gimmick for a transparent table salt grinder at least). One tastes pleasantly \\""fishy\\"".    The smoked salts differ the most and are the most interesting by far and are quite different from each other. When ground in a mortar, you can tell it's just a surface coating, but they are much nicer than liquid smoke flavor, and the flavor survives just fine when ground. The most intense smoked one (Hickory) is now my favorite addition to bulky salad (olives, cheese, radish sprouts, sour cream, bamboo shoots, roast pepita seeds, horseradish, Worcestershire, sesame oil). It's an aftertaste, actually, that noticeably builds up, making each bite more dynamic. Their aroma is intense too and has its own dynamic. I'm delighted that I can buy hickory smoked salt in bulk now! It might be overkillfor some dishes though.    Alas, I have not in fact discovered a whole palette of flavors, just various textures and discolorations of salt, with much difficulty in figuring out which if any are favorites. Most are quite better than normal salt since for some reason when similarly ground, normal salt comes on way too fast. I can rule out about a third which translate to \\""just as harshly one dimensional as table salt\\"". On scrambled eggs, it's a tough call. The serious division between \\""harsh\\"" and \\""subtle\\"" is stark, but I don't notice much variation of subtlety.    Another big difference is between highly crystalline vs. \\""wet\\"" samples. They may not actually be full of moisture but may just have more types of ingredients than just sodium chloride so have failed to crystallize as pure salt prior to being mined, but the \\""wet\\"" ones would not work well in a table grinder at all. The bottles are labeled as to each samples uses (finishing, table, cooking).    As a product, it would make a great gift, and in fact was packaged as a gift, with burlap sacks tied with twine. The labels are high quality bare paper. As an avid cook, I'd have been blown over had anybody given me this as a gift. I give it four stars since it did not come with what would have been most interesting off all: a brochure explaining the origin and rough mineral content of each sample. The \\""fishy\\"" one has sulfur in the name, and the taste fits that description.    Next step: after quickly discarding the obvious poseurs (merely pretty colored samples that lack any subtlety), a process of elimination! I don't intend to keep this kit, despite the social fun it might be, but to in fact toss one tube at a time until I'm down to only one or two smoked versions and only one table salt alternative, with the sulfur one needing separate consideration. I can't taste the sulfur one on eggs, for obvious reason that they are already sulfurous. It's way too hard to compare one to another, and crazy too, since A/B variations would number in the thousands, but quite easy to compare one at a time to normal salt, so that's why I'll do, to get rid of as many as possible. That last thing I'm interested in is fooling myself, so if half my salad or eggs or whatever routine meal I make doesn't taste truly superior with a given tube's contents, out it goes! I predict, after this second day of playing around that I will quickly eliminate a tube or two a day until it becomes more a consideration of texture and availability of a single normal salt alternative. I am almost completely convinced that normal salt really does pack too much punch due to lack of other ionic minerals in the product.    My taste buds got too overwhelmed trying to solve the puzzle in one day. What fun, to do taste tests every day for days going on weeks!",0.9968,positive

I would also encourage blending this tea with red rooibos or green rooibos--you can buy combinations of these teas for 11+ dollars for three oz; ridiculous. This tea is also delicious blended with tisanes ('teas' made up entirely herbs, fruits, etc that don't contain actual tea). The English Tea Store, which can be found on amazon sells a bunch of herbal tisanes that are very good blended with a bit of honeybush (I have blended Lady Hannah's whole fruit tea with the same amount of Davidson's Honeybush with delicious results) .

Heinz Single-Serve Packet,Grocery,5,"This taco sauce is bought by the military and I grab some whenever I eat on base to add flavor to food.

Many in today's America would call it a mild. I really enjoy putting it in canned tomato based soups for added flavor it turns blah into decent. I'm happy Amazon has it and like the packets as opposed to a bottle so it will stay fresh longer and be more convenient to use for bag lunches and picnics. Heinz makes some great condiments, no doubt, and they are reasonably priced.

The hemp seeds are fantastic tasting and being it is 100% wheat free, so far it has not seen the huge spike in price other cereal has.(subject to change?) Hemp seeds are incredibly healthy as they contain at least 25% high quality protein and 40% fat (\\""good\\"" fat), it has a remarkable fatty acid profile, being high in the desirable omega-3s and also delivering some GLA (gamma-linolenic acid) that is absent from the fats we normally eat. (Although even higher amounts of hemp seed than is found in a single serving is required to make the best use of it's nutritional properties) A word of -CAUTION- if you for any reason are subject to drug testing Hemp seeds can contain trace amounts of THC not from the seeds themselves but from contact with leaves etc which also only contain TRACE amounts of THC. It is no where near potent enough to effect even the youngest of children but may turn up in a test for THC.

And if you disregard the product's instructions, it might be possible to do a kind of limited cooking in the bag: Put whatever you want to cook into the bag, add stones which have been heated to a high temperature, and seal the bag. The heat from the stones might cook the food adequately if you give it enough time. Problem is, the bag can't handle things which are hotter than 350F, so you would need a LOT of stone to hold enough thermal energy to actually do the cooking.",-0.7841,negative

Now, onto my review & update...<br /><br />I ordered the 12-pack of Stacy's Pita Chips on June 18, 2012 and received them two days later. Coincidentally, I had bought another bag at my local grocery store over the weekend. When I received my shipment from Amazon, I was astonished and very upset that all 12 bags' \\""Sell By\\"" date was Aug 14, 2012, which is less than two months away. Compare that to the bag I bought at the grocery store over the weekend, which had a Dec 02, 2012 \\""Sell By\\"" date.<br /><br />This would be an great deal if not for the \\""Sell By\\"" date being so close, but there is NO WAY that I will consume 12 bags in that short time frame. At the very least, these chips should give the consumer three months of freshness. I feel somewhat ripped off.<br /><br />UPDATE: Amazon has given me a full refund of my purchase and allowed me to re-order at the same price with free one-day shipping. This is why I'm a loyal Amazon Prime user. Thank you Amazon!<br /><br />UPDATE #2: I would love to buy these in bulk from Amazon again, but $30+ is overpriced and can be beaten at a local grocery store on most weeks depending on where you live.",0.9625,positive

"Barilla Pasta Sauce Variety Pack, 24 Ounce, 4 Jars",Grocery,5,"I'm of 100 percent Itaian descent, and the one thing we never, ever, ever do is use jarred sauce (or 'gravy,' as Tony Soprano and my relative say.) The truth is that it's relatively easy and fast to make a decent pasta sauce for weeknight dinners. So with those two provisos in hand, I've never used any sauce that didn't come from my handiwork or one of my relatives.<br /><br />I was going to pass on the Barilla pack, but I hesitated. I really like their pasta; it doesn't go to mush the way other do, and it has a firm texture that stands up and a hearty taste. I figured, if it's bad, I can just dump it.<br /><br />I was very pleasantly surprised, and kind of shocked. The regular sauce is really pretty good! No, it's not like mine, but then, what is until I go into patenting my own recipe? It has a good taste, something along the lines of what I might find in the taste of sauces from my favorite pizzeria. The basil sauce, on the other hand, came very close to a summer sauce I make myself - now that was a real shocker!<br /><br />I'm amazed that jarried pasta sauces have gotten this good! I'll keep making my own (which is a LOT cheaper than buying it readymade), but if taste is your only consideration, you're going to LIKE Barilla!",0.9892,positive

Use a thin piece of plastic (I cut a piece from an old Smart Balance margarine tub) and insert between each cookie, sliding down slowly and firmly until they separate. A couple crumbled anyway but most separated without breaking. Then freeze the cookies separately on a cookie sheet on waxed or parchment paper, and rewrap them (individual sandwich bags or with a bit of waxed paper between each cookie) and refrigerate them after you take them out of the freezer.<br /><br />Also, I bought my Dark Chocolate Digestives at an Indian market in my neighborhood in NJ.

StrawBerried Treasure,Grocery,5,"I used this at a get together with the girls. It was fabulously easy to do. I believe it calls for Sour Cream to be added, but I always have to do things a bit of my ow way and mixed it up with half sour cream and half whipped cream cheese. I let it sit in the frige overnight in Tuppperware just to make absolutely certain that all the flavors mixed and it chilled well: the instructions advise at lease one hour if you are pushed for time.<br />The next AM, I capped two quarts of lucious strawberries and put them on a decorative platter and covered all with wrap until time for the ladies to come and the fun to begin. 15 minutes before game time, I put the StrawBerried Treasure (now adequately cooled with flavor mixed into the sour cream and cream cheese), in a delightfully pretty cut glass bowl, arrange the berries on the platter around the bowl of dip and set it out with the other snacks I had available.<br />The StrawBerried Treasure was the Hit of The Afternoon. No one could stand it until I had \\""given up\\"" my secret...\\""Amazon ladies, of course\\""...and they all promptly headed home saying that they were ordering their packs right away.<br />It really was good. There was just a bit left over at the end of the afternoon and I took the dip and berries, put them on a smaller plate and plopped myself in front of the boob tube to relax after entertaining the afternoon away. (Such a rough life!) All alone, I cherished each bite that was left...just me, the dip and the berries. Well, the cats were there also,  but they soon discovered they had no taste for berries, though they were happy to grab a bite of dip from time to time. Truly it was great and I was thankful to find this. It is easy, fast, worth the price and makes you look like you have slaved all morning to produce such a delithful dip. So, I recommend it to all you harried party givers who need something fast and easy which makes you look like the Queen of the Kitchen. This is it! So, buy up!!!",0.9979,positive

San Francisco Bay One Cup,Grocery,5,"When I bought my Keurig Brewer from Costco the purchase price of $150.00 included a variety of the plastic Keurig K-Cup coffee.

I just guessed that it probably wasn't a good idea to drink 3 cups daily of boiling water that went through plastic only seconds before. I checked a couple of my health websites and sure enough, those plastics under those conditions are shown/thought to be carcinogenic. That's enough to keep me away from the Keurig and other like brands! San Francisco Bay brand not only has the filter in lieu of the plastic, it also taste great. I like a full bodied coffee without a burnt bean flavor (often found in Starbucks). This fills the bill.

Joseph's Maltitol Sweetner Syrup 12 oz.,Grocery,5,"Jorge Cruise recommends this product for a substitute in his Brownie recipe for people on the Belly Fat Cure program ([...]).  I searched EVERYWHERE in the Chicagoland area and noone knew what I was talking about.    I finally found it on Amazon and a few other websites.  I figured I would only order 2 bottles until I found out whether or not it lived up to my expectations.    After one recipe of Brownies, I had to immediately reorder, this time by the case!    It really is delicious stuff, although, as with all sugar replacements, you need to eat this in small amounts as the body doesn't always adjust immediately to these types of replacements. I highly recommend this product.",0.8646,positive
Goya Stuffed Olives Minced Anchovies 5.25 Ounces (Pack of 12),Grocery,5,"I've been buying the Roland anchovy stuffed olives for a couple of years and thought they were pretty good...at least until I  tried the Goyas. There is no comparison between the two--the Goya is firm, fresh, consistent color and terrific with the perfect amount of anchovies. In the last order of Goya, each can was individually wrapped in bubble wrap without a mark on them! Compare that to the Rolands which looked like they'd been used for batting practice. Honestly, there was not a can in the last case without one or more dents--some so bad that I couldn't open the top without cutting it off only to find less than attractive olives inside.<br /><br />The Roland olives appear to have become an afterthought to the company since the quality of the olive itself has slipped terribly. Every can has  soft, mushy and discolored olives--many shades of yellow, not green. Did they harvest the rejects left over on the ground or what? I've dropped my subscription to Roland and am going only with Goya--at least until they do the same thing as Roland has if they do. If not, these are my anchovy stuffed olive of choice.",0.6879,positive

Lakewood Organic Biodynamic Juice,Grocery,5,"I have a congenital liver disorder called Gilbert's Syndrome and my nurse friend said that organic, fresh-pressed apple juice not from concentrate helps cleanse the liver. Lakewood is THE BEST. I use several of their juices. They come in a six pack and for me, this is a good value for exactly what I need. I do combine Bragg Organic Apple Cider Vinegar with &#34;the mother&#34; with this once every few days, because apple cider vinegar alone is ... well, it's awful. Sorry Bragg. Your product rocks, but the taste is horrid. Lakewood Organic Apple juice is like eating a fresh, sweet apple. I can even get my very finicky autistic son to drink this sometimes (minus the apple cider vinegar) and that's quite a feat. I highly recommend this for anyone who is making an effort to be healthy. Watch out for organic juices that are from concentrate. Those are still like drinking sugar water, which is basically regular &#34;juice&#34; ... sugar water. If you want to have the real deal, buy Lakewood Organic Juices from fresh-pressed fruits. Delicious and so healthy. Plus you don't have the mess of using a juicer!!!",0.9863,positive

Guru Energy Drink 8.3 oz (Pack Of 6),Grocery,1,"There have been some modifications to the ingredients in Guru over the last several months and it went from a decent tasting drink to complete crap.  Customer service reps at Guru do anything they can to avoid addressing the issue when you email them.  It's rather hilarious.  It's nice to see Amazon has taken down previous reviews as they no longer stand.  Many friends hate the new taste and we thought something had gone wrong with the batch and contacted Guru directly.  We were given the runaround and were sent a free sample.  Well the free sample tasted just as bad as what we bought.<br /><br />The pictures of the can are incorrect.  Salt has been eliminated from the product, which in my eyes is a good thing and thus the sodium levels have dropped.  Whether or not this affects the taste, I commend the company on the change as salt is extremely unhealthy, but I strongly believe this is not the reason for the significant change in taste.  Next, green tea has been added to the ingredients.  Some people can handle it, others cant.  But if you're drinking the new Guru and getting headaches, it could have something to do with the green tea.  It might also explain the new bitter taste.<br /><br />You can tell if you're drinking a crappy Guru because it is labeled Made in Canada after the ingredients.  Previously the product was made in the USA.  No offense against Canada, it's a wonderful country and has great people, but this is a clear way to identify you've got your hands on the new disgusting version.<br /><br />Let us know when you get it right, Guru!",0.8424,positive

Lee Kum Kee Fine Shrimp Sauce,Grocery,5,"I'd never purchased any Lee Kum Kee products before, but I saw that this shrimp sauce had only 2 ingredients (whole shrimp & salt) so I checked out their website. Most shrimp paste is made by mixing fresh shrimp with salt, pulverizing the combination, then letting it  sit outside to dry in open tanks. (Which can be kinda dicey in places like China, where there's rampant air pollution.) This is what the  company's US website said: **\\""Lee Kum Kee has improved the traditional processing techniques by selecting the best silver shrimp and drying them in a pollution-free greenhouse instead of constantly exposing them to outdoor conditions. This ensures our products are produced in hygenic conditions and guarantees food safety. The shrimp are fermented and dried without adding any preservatives, MSG or artificial coloring so they retain their natural taste.\\""**  That sold me on it. (Amazon also had it for less than than the manufacturer's website.) Unlike every other shrimp paste I've tried, Lee Kum Kee isn't a hard, caked powder. I opened the jar to find a thick pudding consistency, with all the robust shrimp flavor you get from the usual versions of shrimp paste. Because it's wet, you definitely need to refrigerate it once opened. (Bacteria love a wet environment.) But I'm thrilled that I no longer have to use a hammer to break off pieces from a block of shrimp paste. Now, I can spoon out a precise measurement that I don't have to dissolve in boiling water before I can cook with it.",0.9878,positive

Fiesta Chili Beef Soup,Grocery,2,"Of all the food available to us on this planet, none is more divine than the pinto bean.  I haven't yet been able to find one food item that isn't enhanced by the pinto beans rich flavor and remarkable after-taste.  I first read this product as one can of soup for $17.40, which is a steal for anything that contains pinto beans, but when I learned that you were getting TWELVE cans for that price, I ripped a hole in my jeans.... and these weren't your average run of the mill jeans either.  These things were made of the laser-optiplex ultra fiber originally developed by Nasa.  I'd advise you to order some of your own, but these guys are already sold out thanks to me.",0.6462,positive

"Kraft Light Parmesan Asiago Balsamic Vinaigrette Reduced Fat Dressing, 16-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)",Grocery,2,"Kraft website updates that they are changing out sugar for high fructose corn syrup, because they claim sugar is now too expensive. Read your ingredients bottle. This didn't used to have it, but now it looks like it probably will. I know other light dressings have changed over. I haven't seen a new bottle of this one yet though, but I can't see why it would be an exception from their trend. In fact, watch out for ALL Kraft products. This is a universal change.. even the children's drink Capri Sun has changed over!",0.5487,positive

Pure New Zealand Wakame-Independently Tested Lowest Heavy Metals 14.3oz,Grocery,5,"Was thinking I might never be able to eat seaweed again, and was jonesing for it. Fukushima radiation hasn't reached New Zealand, yet, so I was beyond thrilled to find this seaweed available on amazon. Stocked up and am keeping it in the freezer; using it sparingly.

"The Tao of Tea Lemongrass, Certified Organic Herbal Tea, 1-Pounds",Grocery,4,"I got this tea to drink because it has terrific anti-inflammatory properties and is good for the health in general. It has a bit of a &#34;grassy&#34; taste, as one might expect. Thus I mix it with other types of tea to disguise the taste and sweeten it with honey or stevia.",0.6124,positive

Steaz Zero Calorie Berry Energy Drink  12-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24),Grocery,3,"The zero calorie isn't really natural because they use erythritol which is synthetically made in the lab.  It's like sucralose (Splenda) where they try to pass it off as natural when it's not.  If you look real close to the icons on the back of the can you will find one that says Naturally Sweetened with Truvia.  Truvia contains a very tiny amount of stevia and the rest is erythritol made in a lab.  In fact, 3.5 grams of Truvia contains 3 grams erythritol.<br /><br />As a side note, I believe Coca Cola owns Truvia.",0.3966,positive

Grill Mates Molasses Bacon Seasoning 12.75 Container,Grocery,5,"Tried it so far on burgers and chicken with amazing results!!!

Easy recipe: Take a cornish game hen dry it with a paper towel and smother it with ketchup, then sprinkle this seasoning on and bake it...you will have the most tender and delicious bird! My guests raved at how soft and juicy the meat was and wanted to know what BBQ sauce I used, when I told them ketchup and this seasoning they were astonished and thought it impossible that two simple ingredients meld together so well and make an amazing dish! Easy recipe to use on any poultry.",0.9834,positive
